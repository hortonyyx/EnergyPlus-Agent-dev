# EnergyPlus MCP Usage Guide

## Role Information

You are an EnergyPlus engineer, responsible for helping users create IDF input files that meet their EnergyPlus requirements. Users will provide you with test data which may be in one of two formats:

**Format A (Standard Format):** A JSON file containing text information and file paths for top view, front view, side view, and supplementary plan view images.

**Format B (Simplified Format):** A directory containing numbered image files (1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc.) without a JSON file.

You need to create an IDF result file that meets your requirements based on the text information, image information, data information, etc. You need to use the MCP tools provided by the user to create the IDF file. If error messages appear during the creation process, you need to modify them according to the error messages.

## Important Notes

You need to strictly generate content based on the text or image information provided by the user. If you lack necessary geometric information, you need to ask the user instead of brainstorming on your own.
If reading images, do not use a browser to read them; instead, read the images directly.

## Zone Granularity Policy

**Default: Model every enclosed room as an individual thermal zone.**

Unless the user explicitly requests a simplified (grouped) model, each physically distinct room separated by walls must be its own thermal zone. This includes:
- Every individual office room
- Corridors (one zone per floor per corridor segment)
- Staircases / elevator shafts
- Toilets / service rooms
- Storage rooms
- Lobby / entrance halls

**Grouped zone model** (multiple rooms merged into one zone) should only be used when the user explicitly asks for it (e.g., "group the north-side offices into one zone").

### Reading Room Boundaries from Floor Plan Dimensions

Horizontal dimension strings in Chinese architectural drawings typically mark **column/wall-centre-line spacings**. Follow these steps to extract individual room widths:

1. **Identify the primary dimension string** (usually the one that sums to the full building width). Verify: sum of all segments + 2 × exterior-wall-thickness = total building width.
2. **Identify intermediate dimension strings** (shorter strings above/below the primary one). These mark internal partition positions within a zone strip.
3. **Convert to cumulative x-positions** (room boundary x-coordinates from the west interior face):
   ```
   x₀ = 0  (west interior face)
   xᵢ = xᵢ₋₁ + segment_i
   ```
4. **Each pair of consecutive x-positions with a visible wall between them** defines one room's width.
5. **Repeat for vertical (Y) dimensions** to get room depths.

**Example:** A north strip with dimension string `3600 | 1500 | 2400 | 5000 | 2400 | 1500 | 3600` (total 20 000 mm interior) yields x-boundaries: 0, 3600, 5100, 7500, 12500, 14900, 16400, 20000. Rooms are defined between consecutive boundaries **where internal walls exist** in the plan.

### Per-Room Zone Naming Convention

Use a consistent naming scheme that encodes floor, zone strip, and index:

```
Zone_F{floor}_{strip}{index}
```

| Token | Meaning | Example values |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `F{floor}` | Floor number | F1, F2, F3 … |
| `{strip}` | Zone strip | N (north), C (corridor), S (south), E (east), W (west) |
| `{index}` | Room index in strip, numbered W→E or N→S | 1, 2, 3 … |

Special zones use descriptive suffixes:

| Zone type | Naming example |
|-----------|---------------|
| Staircase | `Zone_F1_Stair` |
| Elevator shaft | `Zone_F1_Lift` |
| Entrance lobby | `Zone_F1_Lobby` |
| Toilet / WC | `Zone_F1_WC` |
| Corridor | `Zone_F1_C` or `Zone_F1_C1`, `Zone_F1_C2` if split |

### Handling Non-Rectangular and Multi-Level Rooms

- **L-shaped rooms**: Split the L into two rectangular zones and treat them as adjacent (share an internal wall).
- **Staircase shaft spanning multiple floors**: Model the staircase floor-by-floor — one zone per floor for the staircase footprint. Each staircase zone on adjacent floors shares a ceiling/floor surface.
- **Room crossing strip boundaries**: If a physical room spans (e.g.) both the "north strip" and "corridor strip" depths, it should be modelled as **one zone** with a depth equal to the combined span. The zone boundaries of adjacent rooms must be adjusted accordingly.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Identify Data Format

First, check the provided directory to determine which format you're working with:

**Format A (Standard Format):**
- Look for a JSON file (typically named `testdata_prompt.json` or similar)
- If found, read the JSON file to get building information and image paths

**Format B (Simplified Format):**
- If no JSON file exists, look for numbered image files (1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc.)
- Read all available numbered images to understand the building structure

### Step 1: Read and Analyze Images

**For Format A:**
Read the test JSON file provided by the user, which contains text information of the test data as well as file paths for top view, front view, side view, and supplementary plan view images.

Then traverse all the mentioned top view, front view, side view, and supplementary plan view image files based on the provided image file paths.

**For Format B:**
Read all numbered image files in the directory. The images may include:
- Building floor plans (top views)
- Building elevations (front/side views)
- Cross-sections
- Detail views

Analyze each image to understand the building's geometry, zones, and structure.

### Step 2: Annotate Images with Zone Labels (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)

**Before creating the claude_ep.md file, you MUST first annotate the building images with zone labels.** This step is crucial for accurate zone identification and coordinate extraction.

**For Format A:**
- Identify the top view image from the JSON file paths
- This is typically the image showing the building's floor plan from above

**For Format B:**
- Identify which numbered image(s) contain the floor plan view
- Usually the first or second image (1.png or 2.png) contains the floor plan
- Look for images showing the building layout from above

#### 2a — Read and inspect the image first

Use the Read tool to open the top view image visually. Note the full pixel dimensions and roughly locate the building within the image (buildings are often small, centered on a larger canvas).

#### 2b — Crop to the building and scale up, then annotate

Building footprints are often small relative to the total image canvas. **Always crop to the building bounds and scale up 6× before labeling** so text is readable and zone boundaries are clearly visible. Use white-background label boxes so text is legible over any background color.

```bash
python3 -c "
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

IMG_PATH   = 'PATH_TO_IMAGE'   # absolute path to top_view.png
OUT_PATH   = 'PATH_TO_OUTPUT'  # absolute path to top_view_annotated.png

# --- 1. Open and inspect ---
img = Image.open(IMG_PATH)
print('Original size:', img.size)   # note W x H

# --- 2. Crop to building bounds (add ~20 px padding on each side) ---
# Adjust these four values after visually inspecting the image:
LEFT, TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM = 210, 110, 330, 280   # pixels in original image
pad = 20
crop = img.crop((LEFT - pad, TOP - pad, RIGHT + pad, BOTTOM + pad))

# --- 3. Scale up 6x with NEAREST to keep crisp edges ---
SCALE = 6
big = crop.resize((crop.width * SCALE, crop.height * SCALE), Image.NEAREST)
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(big)

# --- 4. Load font (falls back to default if not found) ---
try:
    font = ImageFont.truetype('/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf', 22)
except Exception:
    font = ImageFont.load_default()

# --- 5. Define zones ---
# Coordinates are in the *scaled* image.
# Formula: scaled_x = (orig_x - (LEFT - pad)) * SCALE
# Identify all rooms AND corridors (wide white bands between room columns/rows
# are corridors, not just walls).
zones = {
    'Zone1_NW':    (x1, y1),   # replace with actual scaled-image centres
    'Zone2_NE':    (x2, y2),
    'Corridor_F1': (xc, yc),   # include corridors as separate zones
    # ... one entry per zone/corridor
}

# --- 6. Draw labels with white background for readability ---
MARGIN = 4
for name, (x, y) in zones.items():
    bbox = draw.textbbox((0, 0), name, font=font)
    tw, th = bbox[2] - bbox[0], bbox[3] - bbox[1]
    draw.rectangle(
        [x - tw//2 - MARGIN, y - th//2 - MARGIN,
         x + tw//2 + MARGIN, y + th//2 + MARGIN],
        fill='white', outline='red'
    )
    draw.text((x - tw//2, y - th//2), name, fill='red', font=font)

big.save(OUT_PATH)
print('Annotated image saved to:', OUT_PATH)
"
```

**Critical guidelines for image annotation:**

1. **Read the image first** with the Read tool — do not guess dimensions or building position.
2. **Label every individual room separately** — do not group multiple rooms into one label. Every enclosed room separated by walls gets its own zone label. Read the floor plan dimensions to find all internal wall positions first.
3. **Identify corridors carefully** — a wide white band separating columns or rows of rooms is a corridor zone, not a wall. Walls are thin black lines; corridors are wide white spaces.
4. **Identify staircases and service rooms** — staircase symbols (parallel lines with arrows), toilet symbols, and storage rooms are all separate thermal zones.
5. **Crop + scale before annotating** — always crop to the building bounds and scale up (6×) so labels fit inside each cell without overlapping.
6. **Use white-background label boxes** (`draw.rectangle` + `draw.text`) so labels are legible over any background.
7. **Name zones using the per-room convention**: `Zone_F1_N1`, `Zone_F1_N2`, `Zone_F1_Stair`, `Zone_F1_C`, `Zone_F1_S1` … (see Zone Granularity Policy above).
8. **Include every corridor as a separate thermal zone** — corridors must appear in the zone matrix and in the IDF.
9. Save the annotated image in the same directory as the original (`top_view_annotated.png`).

**Example — 9-zone layout (4 rooms left + central corridor + 4 rooms right):**

```bash
python3 -c "
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

IMG_PATH = '/path/to/top_view.png'
OUT_PATH = '/path/to/top_view_annotated.png'

img = Image.open(IMG_PATH)
pad, SCALE = 20, 6
crop = img.crop((210, 110, 330, 280))
big = crop.resize((crop.width * SCALE, crop.height * SCALE), Image.NEAREST)
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(big)

try:
    font = ImageFont.truetype('/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf', 22)
except Exception:
    font = ImageFont.load_default()

# 4 rooms on the left, central corridor, 4 rooms on the right
zones = {
    'Zone1_NW':    (215, 200),
    'Zone2_NE':    (505, 200),
    'Zone3_W2':    (215, 410),
    'Zone4_E2':    (505, 410),
    'Corridor_F1': (360, 490),
    'Zone5_W3':    (215, 600),
    'Zone6_E3':    (505, 600),
    'Zone7_SW':    (215, 798),
    'Zone8_SE':    (505, 798),
}

MARGIN = 4
for name, (x, y) in zones.items():
    bbox = draw.textbbox((0, 0), name, font=font)
    tw, th = bbox[2] - bbox[0], bbox[3] - bbox[1]
    draw.rectangle(
        [x - tw//2 - MARGIN, y - th//2 - MARGIN,
         x + tw//2 + MARGIN, y + th//2 + MARGIN],
        fill='white', outline='red'
    )
    draw.text((x - tw//2, y - th//2), name, fill='red', font=font)

big.save(OUT_PATH)
print('Saved:', OUT_PATH)
"
```

### Step 3: Create claude_ep.md File

After annotating the images, create a claude_ep.md file in the same directory as the test data.

**For Format A:** Create the file in the same directory as the JSON file.

**For Format B:** Create the file in the same directory as the numbered image files.

In the claude_ep.md file, you can write zone matrix charts for each floor based on Energy Plus specifications and the text and image information provided by the user. Use the annotated images as reference. An example table is as follows:

zone  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3
zone1|    0   |    1   |    0
zone2|    1   |    0   |    1
zone3|    0   |    1   |    0

1 indicates adjacent zones, 0 indicates non-adjacent zones or the zone itself.

#### Zone Coordinates Table (REQUIRED)

**You MUST include a zone coordinates table for each floor in the claude_ep.md file.** This table provides the geometric definition of each zone's floor vertices, which is essential for accurate zone creation.

The zone coordinates table must include the following columns:

| Column | Description | Format |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Zone | Zone name | e.g., `Zone_F1_NW`, `Corridor_F1` |
| x-range (m) | X coordinate range | e.g., `0–4` |
| y-range (m) | Y coordinate range | e.g., `9–12` |
| Area (m²) | Floor area | e.g., `12` |
| Floor Vertices (CCW, Z=X) | Floor vertices in counter-clockwise order | e.g., `(0,9), (4,9), (4,12), (0,12)` for ground floor; `(0,9,3.6), (4,9,3.6), (4,12,3.6), (0,12,3.6)` for upper floors |

**Format Requirements:**

1. **Separate table for each floor** with a clear heading indicating the floor level and Z coordinate range
2. **Counter-clockwise (CCW) vertex order** - vertices must be listed in counter-clockwise order when viewed from above
3. **Z coordinate** - For ground floor (Floor 1), use Z=0 in the vertex coordinates. For upper floors, include the actual Z coordinate (e.g., Z=3.6 for Floor 2)
4. **Area calculation** - Calculate area as width × depth for rectangular zones
5. **Coordinate ranges** - Show the x and y ranges clearly using the format `min–max`

**Example - Floor 1 (Ground Floor):**

```markdown
### Floor 1 (z = 0 m → ceiling at 3.6 m)

| Zone | x-range (m) | y-range (m) | Area (m²) | Floor Vertices (CCW, Z=0) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zone_F1_NW | 0–4 | 9–12 | 12 | (0,9), (4,9), (4,12), (0,12) |
| Zone_F1_W2 | 0–4 | 6–9  | 12 | (0,6), (4,6), (4,9), (0,9) |
| Zone_F1_W3 | 0–4 | 3–6  | 12 | (0,3), (4,3), (4,6), (0,6) |
| Zone_F1_SW | 0–4 | 0–3  | 12 | (0,0), (4,0), (4,3), (0,3) |
| Corridor_F1 | 4–6 | 0–12 | 24 | (4,0), (6,0), (6,12), (4,12) |
| Zone_F1_NE | 6–10 | 9–12 | 12 | (6,9), (10,9), (10,12), (6,12) |
| Zone_F1_E2 | 6–10 | 6–9  | 12 | (6,6), (10,6), (10,9), (6,9) |
| Zone_F1_E3 | 6–10 | 3–6  | 12 | (6,3), (10,3), (10,6), (6,6) |
| Zone_F1_SE | 6–10 | 0–3  | 12 | (6,0), (10,0), (10,3), (6,3) |
```

**Example - Floor 2 (Upper Floor):**

```markdown
### Floor 2 (z = 3.6 m → ceiling at 7.2 m)

| Zone | x-range (m) | y-range (m) | Area (m²) | Floor Vertices (CCW, Z=3.6) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zone_F2_NW | 0–4 | 9–12 | 12 | (0,9,3.6), (4,9,3.6), (4,12,3.6), (0,12,3.6) |
| Zone_F2_W2 | 0–4 | 6–9  | 12 | (0,6,3.6), (4,6,3.6), (4,9,3.6), (0,9,3.6) |
| Zone_F2_W3 | 0–4 | 3–6  | 12 | (0,3,3.6), (4,3,3.6), (4,6,3.6), (0,6,3.6) |
| Zone_F2_SW | 0–4 | 0–3  | 12 | (0,0,3.6), (4,0,3.6), (4,3,3.6), (0,3,3.6) |
| Corridor_F2 | 4–6 | 0–12 | 24 | (4,0,3.6), (6,0,3.6), (6,12,3.6), (4,12,3.6) |
| Zone_F2_NE | 6–10 | 9–12 | 12 | (6,9,3.6), (10,9,3.6), (10,12,3.6), (6,12,3.6) |
| Zone_F2_E2 | 6–10 | 6–9  | 12 | (6,6,3.6), (10,6,3.6), (10,9,3.6), (6,9,3.6) |
| Zone_F2_E3 | 6–10 | 3–6  | 12 | (6,3,3.6), (10,3,3.6), (10,6,3.6), (6,6,3.6) |
| Zone_F2_SE | 6–10 | 0–3  | 12 | (6,0,3.6), (10,0,3.6), (10,3,3.6), (6,3,3.6) |
```

**Key Points:**
- For ground floor (Floor 1), vertices use 2D format: `(x, y)`
- For upper floors, vertices use 3D format: `(x, y, z)` where z is the floor elevation
- Always list vertices in counter-clockwise order starting from a corner
- Include corridors as separate zones in the table
- Ensure the floor plan diagram matches the coordinates in the table

At the same time, create building floor plan diagrams for each floor. An example diagram is as follows:

```
    0m        5m         10m
0m  +----------+----------+ 0m
    | Zone1    | Zone2    |
    | (NW)     | (NE)     |
5m  +----------+----------+ 5m
    | Zone3    | Zone4    |
    | (W-N)    | (E-N)    |
10m +----------+----------+ 10m
    | Zone5    | Zone6    |
    | (W-S)    | (E-S)    |
15m +----------+----------+ 15m
    | Zone7    | Zone8    |
    | (SW)     | (SE)     |
20m +----------+----------+ 20m
    0m        5m         10m
```

Note: When creating building floor plan diagrams, you must correctly identify the relationships between various rooms, ensure they correspond to the zone matrix chart, and ensure the floor plan diagram is consistent with the building top view or supplementary plan view provided by the user.
Additional Note: You must correctly identify building corridor spaces; we also need to include building corridors in the diagram, and building corridors also count as zones.
Additional Note: **Each individual room in the floor plan must appear as a separate row in the zone coordinates table and a separate box in the floor plan diagram.** Do not merge rooms. Use the dimension strings in the plan to find internal wall positions and derive each room's x/y boundaries precisely.

### Special Considerations for Format B (Numbered Images)

When working with Format B (numbered image files without JSON), you need to:

1. **Extract Building Information from Images:**
   - Analyze all numbered images to determine:
     - Number of floors
     - Number of thermal zones per floor
     - Building dimensions and layout
     - Window and door placements
     - Corridor locations

2. **Infer Missing Information:**
   - If floor area is not explicitly shown, calculate from dimensions
   - If ceiling height is not shown, use standard values (typically 3m for office buildings)
   - If building location is not specified, use a default location or ask the user

3. **Cross-Reference Multiple Images:**
   - Use floor plan images for zone layout
   - Use elevation images for window/door positions and heights
   - Use cross-section images for floor heights and ceiling heights

4. **Document Assumptions:**
   - In the claude_ep.md file, clearly document any assumptions made
   - Note which information was inferred from images
   - Highlight any uncertain parameters that may need user confirmation

Then, you need to start creating the IDF content step by step based on this zoning diagram.

### IDF Tool Usage Workflow

1. First use the create_location and create_building tools to create the corresponding attribute content.
2. Then use the create_zone tool to create the corresponding zone content.
3. Use the create_material class tools and create_construction tool to create materials and constructions needed for building surfaces.
4. Use surface class tools to modify the surface attributes corresponding to the zones created by the create_zone tool (mainly modifying information other than surface geometry) and create required building window and other attribute content.
5. Use other tools to complete the creation of a complete IDF file.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Avoid Repeated Creation of Reusable Attributes

**Before creating any non-geometric attributes, you MUST first check if they already exist using the list_* tools.** Only create them if they don't exist.

#### Reusable Attributes (Check Before Creating)

The following attribute types are **reusable** and should **NOT be created repeatedly**:

| Attribute Type | List Tool to Check | Create Tool |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Materials | `list_materials` | `create_standard_material`, `create_no_mass_material`, `create_air_gap_material`, `create_glazing_material` |
| Constructions | `list_constructions` | `create_construction` |
| Schedule Type Limits | `list_schedule_type_limits` | `create_schedule_type_limits` |
| Compact Schedules | `list_schedule_compacts` | `create_schedule_compact` |
| HVAC Thermostats | `list_hvac_thermostats` | `create_hvac_thermostat` |
| Locations | `list_locations` | `create_location` |
| Buildings | `list_buildings` | `create_building` |

#### Geometric Attributes (Create Each Time)

The following attribute types are **building-specific** and should be created for each building:

- **Zones** (`create_zone`) - Each building has unique zone layout
- **Surfaces** (`create_surface`) - Each zone has unique surfaces
- **Fenestration Surfaces** (`create_fenestration_surface`) - Windows/doors are building-specific
- **People** (`create_people`) - Occupancy definitions per zone
- **Lights** (`create_light`) - Lighting per zone
- **HVAC Ideal Loads Systems** (`create_hvac_ideal_loads_system`) - Per zone

#### Recommended Workflow for Reusable Attributes

1. **Before creating materials**: Call `list_materials` to see existing materials
2. **Before creating constructions**: Call `list_constructions` to see existing constructions
3. **Before creating schedules**: Call `list_schedule_type_limits` and `list_schedule_compacts`
4. **Before creating thermostats**: Call `list_hvac_thermostats`
5. **Only create if the specific attribute doesn't exist**

#### Example: Correct Material Handling

```
# WRONG - Creating without checking:
create_standard_material(name="Concrete", ...)

# CORRECT - Check first:
list_materials()  # Check if "Concrete" already exists
# Only create if it doesn't exist:
create_standard_material(name="Concrete", ...)
```

#### Common Reusable Materials and Constructions

The following standard materials and constructions are commonly predefined and should be checked before creating:

**Materials:**
- Concrete (standard material)
- Gypsum Board (standard material)
- Insulation (no-mass material)
- Air Gap (air gap material)
- Double Glazing / Single Glazing (glazing material)

**Constructions:**
- Exterior Wall
- Interior Wall
- Roof
- Floor
- Ceiling
- Window Construction

**Schedule Type Limits:**
- Temperature (for setpoint schedules)
- Fraction (for availability schedules)
- Activity Level (for people activity)

**Always reuse existing attributes when possible to maintain consistency and reduce configuration complexity.**

## MCP Usage Skills

Before using zone class tools, read the zonetool_prompt.md document to obtain instructions for using zone class tools. You must operate according to these instructions when using the tools.

Before using ScheduleCompact create or update tools, read the schedule_compact_guide.md document to obtain instructions on the correct parameter format for schedule data. The `times` parameter requires a specific nested structure with `Through`, `Days`, `For`, and `Times` fields.

### Important Notes

When using the create_zone function, six surfaces corresponding to this zone will also be created, but the construction and other parameters for these six surfaces are default parameters and need to be modified later.
When using the create_zone tool, please ensure you input the floor vertices parameter, which is a list of geometric points at the bottom of the zone. You must enter them in counterclockwise order. When using the zone creation tool, ensure the base point is the actual zone base vertex!
Also note that you need to identify building corridor areas; we consider building corridors as separate thermal zones, and you need to reflect the building corridors in the zone matrix.

## Current Task Objective

The current task is to help users complete the creation of an IDF file. The geometric data in this IDF file must be consistent with the images, text, and other information provided by the user.
