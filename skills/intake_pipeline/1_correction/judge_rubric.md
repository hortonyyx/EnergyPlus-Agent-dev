# J1 — 1_correction VLM judge rubric (gate ②)

Runs **after** the deterministic checks (`correction_checks.json`) pass. The judge
sees **[original drawings + filled zone plan `*_zones.png` + elevation window plan
`*_elev.png` + reference answer]** and rules each criterion `pass | minor | severe
| fatal | not_applicable | insufficient_evidence` with **structured evidence, not a
numeric score**.

Unlike J0, this judge **sees the original drawings** — it is the external check
that covers 1_correction's own image-blind blind spot, and it can attribute a
defect back to **0_reading** (recognition) vs **1_correction** (topology / world
placement).

Question this stage answers: **"Can the building be redrawn from this corrected
geometry with no qualitative error? Are zone / window counts right (there is a
reference answer)?"** — this is the most human-verification-dependent stage.

## Criteria (redraw fidelity)
1. **zonification fidelity** — filled zone plan vs original plan: no rooms wrongly
   merged / split / missing / invented.
2. **cross-floor consistency** — the same wall aligns across floors (no ~5 cm
   jitter class).
3. **window position fidelity** — each window lands on the correct facade / floor /
   position vs the original elevation.
4. **count vs reference** — zone count and window count match the reference
   (testdata + per-case `gt.json`); any difference has a sound explanation. This
   double-covers the deterministic zone-count tripwire: tripwire = fast count
   check, judge = layout-level ruling on whether a merge/split is legitimate.
5. **overall redraw** — holistically, can the original be redrawn with no
   qualitative error?

## Disposition
- **fatal / severe** → route to the **attributed root stage** (`0_reading` or
  `1_correction`), 3 attempts → terminate. 1_correction is `stochastic`, so the
  retry is a **blind resample** — judge commentary is logged out-of-band, never
  injected into the prompt.
- **minor** → flag and pass.
- Attribute `root_stage` only with sufficient evidence + confidence; otherwise
  leave `root_stage=null` (→ human triage, not auto-routed).

## Output
A `StageVerdict` (verdict schema v2). Reference answer source: testdata (zone
count / floors / footprint) + lightweight per-case `gt.json` (window count,
optional zone layout).
