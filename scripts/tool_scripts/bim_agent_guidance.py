# 09-30 fix of the 09-29 v1. Failures targeted: run94 justified leaving drawn dividers
# out with the open-space rule; moved doors to clear a host error (#47); said
# "illegible, equal split assumed" without magnifying (2F); mixed crop/grid
# coordinate wording (A6). Drawing-only wall rules live in DRAWING_METHOD so mesh
# and view inputs keep their inference of missing interiors.
# C2: the first full review found CORE's unconditional look-again instruction
# contradicted T1's final 15% rule. Use that bounded finishing rule throughout.
CORE = """Build a viewable lightweight BIM of the target building from the supplied
inputs. You choose observations, tools and revisions; no tool sequence is fixed.

What matters, in order: the actual physical spaces and the partitions between
them; each floor's shape and level; every door and window with its position,
width and height on its real wall; and door connectivity. Room uses come after
the geometry. No EnergyPlus objects or materials.
- Preserve evidence of physical partitions; furniture or use alone does not
  establish a wall. Missing interiors may be explicitly inferred at the requested
  simplification. Keep each real space whole: never split it into boxes or add false walls
  or floors, and never merge spaces the input separates; an open space stays one
  space even if its use varies. An opening connects two separate spaces; it
  never merges them.
- Never move, shorten, delete or relabel an observed opening merely to clear a
  host or compile error; such an error usually means a wall, room or endpoint
  is wrong, so recheck the input there. Distinguish observed repetition from
  inferred repetition, and label inferred interiors and circulation explicitly.
  Unknown door state stays unknown.
- Keep observed, inferred and assumed content distinct. What you have not yet
  viewed, or viewed but not yet made out, is unresolved, not missing: a draft
  may carry it with a labelled provisional value. Recheck within the finishing
  budget below. Only information the inputs lack, or that stays undeterminable
  after a reasonable look, becomes an explicit assumption with its reason.
  Centring, equal spacing, symmetry or copying never count as observation.
- Valid geometry, tool acceptance, your own confirmations and returned images do
  not show that the model matches the input; only comparison with it does.
Units are metres; x east, y north, z absolute world height on every floor.
Image positions are ORIGINAL pixels: read them from a view's grid labels, or
convert a returned-image pixel with that view's crop origin and
original_pixels_per_returned_pixel. Keep object IDs stable.

# 09-30 replacement of v1. Failures targeted: v1 required row-by-row magnified reading
# before any build, so first drafts still came after 41-77 calls (run69-94) and later
# floors were rushed (run93/94 2F); its "a full view is too small" contradicted run57
# (no crops, 29/29 positions); its whole-row crops could not magnify under the 1600 px
# limit (run94 1.08x); drawn dividers read as absent (run94 1F south); heights taken
# from a chain measuring another opening (run94 claims 0001/0003).

# and applied the ordinary-window chain to both 4800 mm windows.
DRAWING_METHOD = """Drawing method, for measured plans and elevations. The drawings give the
structure; every floor's saved draft is then checked against them.

1. READ THE WHOLE SET. View every supplied plan and elevation in full. From each
plan take the outer perimeter, every drawn divider, every door and window mark,
the dimension chains and the north arrow. A divider is a line pair (or a single
or filled line) meeting other walls, often carrying door symbols or ending a
dimension segment; furniture, labels, hatching, door swings and dimension lines
are not dividers. Build every drawn divider, however thin, unfilled or faint, and
none that is not drawn. Several doors from one corridor into what you read as one
space are a reason to look again for dividers between them. Follow each space's
full extent, including corridor turns and nonrectangular parts.

2. LOOK CLOSER WHERE NEEDED. Magnify wherever a mark, label or dimension is not
clear at the current size. Returned images are at most 1600 px on the long side,
so a smaller box shows more: a box whose longest side is under about 500 px can
be shown 3x. Include the mark's
wall, its neighbours and the labels you will use. Place every door and window
from its own mark: the two jambs of its wall gap, its drawn frame or its own
dimension segment.

3. CALIBRATE ONCE PER PLAN. Scale each plan from its overall dimension
annotations against the wall lines their extension lines reach. Put each wall
on the plane its dimensions refer to: commonly the outer face for the perimeter
and the centre of a divider's line pair. Take divider and opening positions
from labelled internal chains, read in drawing order; the segments must add up
to the overall value. Use one origin for all floors with x east and y north as
the north arrow shows (usually north is up the sheet, so world y grows as pixel
y falls); geometry_feedback.axis_orientation reports a mirrored calibration.
In world-length slots write {"value":15000,"unit":"mm"} for a 15000 mm label;
bare numbers mean metres.

4. DRAFT EVERY FLOOR. Declare each floor's perimeter, all dividers and all
openings in one build_plan_bim call; a divider continues through its door, which
is declared as an opening. Use claim_transaction's facade_count form (claims reference)
to record each floor/facade's observed window total, including zero; facade_counts
compares these totals after saves and lists uncounted facades. Draft every floor before
refining any one floor in detail; local looks needed to declare or compile a
draft can happen at any time. Each upper floor comes from its own drawing;
combine floors with assemble_plan_bim. A room count, seed or use never justifies
adding or removing a divider.

5. RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES. drawing_differences compares ink with declared
walls/openings; zero covers only its stated scope. Plan builds and assembly
automatically connect endpoints within the reported tolerance (at most 0.30 m) before strict
compilation and regularize eligible offsets below 0.30 m; if a junction still rejects,
set its named endpoint to the exact original-pixel target in the error. Remaining near
faces or any room part narrower than 0.60 m reject the draft. Read the
regularization summary and saved full trace: same-floor merges keep the perimeter
fixed; assembly also aligns near perimeter edges across floors. Openings follow
their host. Repair rejected objects from evidence; check the source and overlay.

6. HEIGHTS FROM ELEVATIONS. Match each exterior opening to its elevation by
facade, storey, order and span, checking which way the elevation faces. Read
its sill and head from the dimension chain that measures that opening, in order
from the chain's datum; a chain can add up while its segments are swapped, and
a chain measuring one opening does not measure another. Openings of a different
size or shape keep their own heights unless the elevation shows otherwise.
Use view_elevation_candidate with observed anchors to locate the source openings;
claim source boxes must cover those openings, not only an adjacent dimension chain.
height_coverage lists evidenced/problem openings and counts the rest; full rows are
in details_file. A region covering several openings requires per-opening
confirmation; whole-image citations are unlocalized. Internal door heights without a
drawing are assumptions.

in the original plan and original elevation. Include doors and windows; retain
uncertain marks explicitly. Do not copy one view's intervals into the other.
Choose corresponding full-axis endpoints from drawing evidence, each with its
own original pixel positions and the same observed total length in metres.
Call compare_facade_spans with exact image names, their x/y image axes, and
observations_json. A synthetic format example (not a case answer):
{"plan":{"axis_anchors":[[10,0],[110,10]],"openings":[
{"id":"P1","pixels":[20,40],"kind":"unknown","evidence":"original crop"}]},
"elevation":{"axis_anchors":[[200,0],[400,10]],"openings":[
{"id":"E1","pixels":[340,380],"kind":"unknown","evidence":"original crop"}]}}
To adopt view_pixel_profile measurements, replace any pixel number (including
an axis anchor's pixel) with {"profile":"profile_001","candidate":"C01","at":"peak"}.
Use the actual returned profile_id and candidate ID. at may be peak, start or end
(default peak); it selects the measured band's peak or either inclusive endpoint.
For example pixels:[{"profile":"profile_001","candidate":"C02"},
{"profile":"profile_001","candidate":"C05","at":"end"}] binds both endpoints
directly to saved measurements. These synthetic IDs do not prescribe actual groups.
The tool checks the measurement's original image/axis/hash and saves the reference,
record hash and resolved coordinate. No offsets, automatic grouping or snapping.
Numeric slots remain available for explicitly identified visual estimates or other
evidence; do not call them profile measurements. If a scan misses necessary marks,
reinspect the original and choose another crop/color/threshold or record uncertainty.
Candidate peaks are ink, not openings: check the full aperture and surrounding wall
before grouping endpoints. To inspect whole coloured frames rather than isolated
endpoints, use view_pixel_region_overview with a target ink RGB in background_rgb.
This legacy parameter also accepts ink; it is not restricted to room backgrounds.
Choose the colour/tolerance from the original; antialiasing can make a visually
bright line much darker in its actual pixels. Inspect region_exclusions: small
strokes can be filtered by min_pixels, and max_regions can truncate the list.
Pass relevant returned seed_pixel values to view_pixel_region with the same colour
settings. Its bbox is [xmin,ymin,xmax_exclusive,ymax_exclusive] in ORIGINAL pixels;
it is a raster extent, not an automatically accepted aperture endpoint. Inspect a
clean magnified original crop covering the entire extent and the neighbouring wall.
Keep component IDs and the reason for grouping or rejecting each relevant piece.
One physical frame can be broken by overprinted dimensions or antialiasing; several
panels/leaves inside one opening are not automatically several wall apertures.
Conversely, a matching colour can include unrelated doors, labels or furniture.
Compare visible wall interruptions and frame continuity; do not assign every
dimension segment to an opening. Use profiles to refine chosen geometric endpoints
after grouping. Tool candidates alone do not decide physical identity.
Dimension text/extension lines are not automatically
footprint anchors. Recheck large residuals and submit an updated comparison when
the observations change; a prose correction does not revise the saved record.
The tool maps each view independently and compares forward/reversed elevation
spans paired by centre order only when counts match. Different counts retain both
complete lists as unresolved and produce no pairs or residuals; a symmetric
arrangement also leaves direction unresolved. relative_error_separated only says
the two mean residuals differ by more than the declared ambiguity tolerance;
absolute_fit_status remains not_evaluated. A smaller error alone does not prove
correct observations, and large absolute residuals require rechecking anchors,
completeness and endpoints.
Use the corresponding original crops to resolve door/window identity, door arcs,
wall interruptions and elevation height chains. Do not change a physical partition
or split an opening merely to accommodate inconsistent coordinates. The saved
report preserves input pixels, extra evidence fields and original image hashes;
it is arithmetic evidence, never a source-fidelity pass or an automatic repair.

All plan points use ORIGINAL image pixels. x/y anchors each contain two
[pixel_coordinate, world_metres] pairs; both anchors must lie in the image.
Pixel coordinates may also reference a saved view_pixel_profile candidate:
{"profile":"profile_001","candidate":"C02","at":"peak"} (start/end also work).
For an explicitly chosen midplane between two measured faces, use
{"midpoint":[{"profile":"profile_001","candidate":"C02"},
             {"profile":"profile_001","candidate":"C03"}]}.
References work in x/y anchor pixels, footprint/partition points, opening p1/p2,
and seed points, including local revisions. They must match the original image
and coordinate axis. Profile candidates are ink bands, not wall labels. Reuse
the same selected coordinate at touching wall/opening endpoints. World length
slots (anchor second values, z_floor, ceiling_height, opening z) accept either
numbers IN METRES or explicit {"value":15000,"unit":"mm"} quantities (m/cm/mm).
Units apply per value, never to pixels; code converts tagged lengths to metres.
The submitted references/quantities, numeric compiled plan and exact
bindings are saved separately; numeric-only declarations keep their old format.
geometry_feedback returns effective footprint bounds/spans, metres per pixel
and opening dimensions, including failed host drafts. Check these against the
original annotations. Huge spans inconsistent with declared heights are rejected
as possible mm/metre mix-ups; values are never automatically rescaled.
drawing_differences lists where the original's ink and the declaration disagree.
Keep calibration and geometry in the SAME coordinate frame. Identify each
representative plane: the perimeter may use observed outer faces while internal
dividers use measured midplanes. Document that choice; do not confuse a face
dimension with a centreline dimension or apply an unobserved half-thickness.
World z is absolute. basis explains observed dimensions and reference planes.
Current scope: ONE floor, simple orthogonal outer footprint without holes,
orthogonal partitions; footprint and rooms may be nonrectangular. Trace every
outer turn, including recesses; never fill the bounding rectangle or add walls
to split a continuous space into boxes. Windows on recessed exterior edges are
supported; code derives their outward direction from the calibrated outer ring.
Nonorthogonal rings, holes and ambiguous hosts explicitly fail.
partitions are complete physical divider paths, including bends and continuation
through a door aperture. Put the aperture separately in openings. Shared path
endpoints describe actual junctions. Before strict compilation, the build entry
automatically joins endpoints within its reported tolerance (at most 0.30 m) and
regularizes near parallel lines; a remaining junction error gives the named original-
pixel endpoint and exact target to copy. It preserves the outer footprint and moves
hosted openings with their wall.
Targets prefer dimension references, then the perimeter, then the line shared
by more walls/floors. Sub-0.30 m wall strips collapse even with named seeds:
strip seeds are removed, hosted openings move to the retained line, overlapping
opening spans merge and disjoint spans remain. The trace records removed IDs,
survivors and connections; an unreconcilable connection rejects the merge.
Remaining near faces or any room portion narrower than 0.60 m reject the save.
The compiler itself never snaps. The saved plan.regularization records version
plan_regularization_v1 and the full trace; submitted_plan.json retains the input.
The reply contains counts, largest move, rejections and a full-report file/hash.
regularization_inputs.coordinate_references contains axis, value_m, basis
('dimension'), chain_id, tick_index and source_refs; line_references contains
partition_id, basis ('dimension' or 'ink') and source_refs. Plan-reader trial
alone supplies these from checked dimensions/ink; this build entry does not
read new dimensions or align to image ink. Historical replay policy belongs
to the run manifest, never to a model-declared plan field.
Every enclosed face becomes one space. No room count is supplied or enforced.
An open passage still leaves two faces and two spaces, even at full ceiling height.
Use it for an evidenced opening in a real separating wall. A corridor bend or
continuation without a physical separator belongs to ONE face: do not draw a
closing line there just to host a passage. To repair an overextended partition,
update its points to one real wall portion and add the other real portions as
separate paths with coincident actual junctions. Remove any invented opening on
the removed portion in the SAME revision. The compiler then derives the merged
space and its actual opening hosts; do not manually recreate every room polygon.
Optional space_seeds assign IDs/roles to containing faces; every unseeded face is
retained with a stable derived ID and unknown role. Seeds are points INSIDE rooms,
not wall points. Two seeds in one face fail rather than inventing a divider.
The whole opening segment must belong to exactly one exterior host or two
interior hosts. A door spanning a wall junction fails; no width is clipped.
kind is window, door or open. Only exterior facade windows are supported here;
doors/open passages may connect rooms or outdoors. Door state defaults unknown;
its optional state is unknown/open/closed. For open passages state is open or
omitted; window state is not supported. Preserve IDs, source_refs and assumptions.
Empty openings or incomplete observed coverage is allowed ONLY as an explicit
partial draft: record unexamined views and omissions in unresolved. A partial
draft does not establish room completeness or drawing fidelity.
The raw declaration and deterministic mapping are retained in plan_drafts.
Local revision: inspect_plan_draft('draft_NNN') returns declaration and plan_sha256;
use 'resume' for an explicitly supplied saved pixel plan. Pass that hash as
expected_plan_sha256 to revise_plan_bim(draft_id, expected_plan_sha256,
operations_json). operations_json is a list of 1-100 operations. Each needs
reason and nonempty source_refs, plus:
- update: collection, id, changes (nonempty fields, no id).
- add: collection, value (complete new row with a new id).
- remove: collection, id.
- set: field, value (top-level scalar/array fields except floor_id and collections).
Collections are partitions, openings, space_seeds; edit each row/field once per
batch. Example operation on the synthetic declaration above:
{"op":"update","collection":"openings","id":"D1","changes":{"z":[0,2.2]},
"reason":"explicit revised height assumption","source_refs":["height assumed"]}
The revision response includes geometry_changes: resolved opening endpoints,
widths and heights before/after, including indirect changes from calibration.
The full file is retained if the response is truncated. Untouched declarations
remain exact before regularization; the saved trace records indirect movement.
Changed topology may change derived rooms and hosts. Every revision saves a NEW
full draft and runs the same regularizer, strict compiler and
source/overlay feedback. Failed compilation preserves its draft and error; it does
not invalidate the parent. Removing a divider may require removing a redundant
space seed if both points now occupy the same actual space.
On compilation failure, the original error is retained and a draft-only overlay
shows the submitted footprint, partition IDs and aperture endpoints. Unrenderable
items are listed explicitly. This is not a source BIM or a claim of room validity.
Successful source export returns its actual plan and original overlay; anchors
are registered for later revise_bim.
Existing candidates can be revised with revise_bim; this compiler creates a fresh
single-floor candidate, so do not use it to silently discard other floors.
For several distinct plans use assemble_plan_bim (plan_assembly); it retains each
plan and places it at an explicit base level.

Use inspect_plan_draft for the exact hash; an explicitly supplied resume plan is
also admitted as draft_id=resume. Every listed draft is recompiled against its
bound original image. IDs become floor_id:original_id, including opening hosts.
Drafts must use a common XY origin/direction. Assembly aligns corresponding
near wall planes strictly below 0.30 m by editing drafts and recompiling them;
it never edits source polygons. Internal walls prefer dimensions, then the line
shared by more floors, then the lower floor. Overlapping perimeter edges, including
recesses, align upper to lower; reverse only when the upper edge alone has a
dimension-chain reference. Same-floor merges keep the perimeter fixed. Hosted
openings and connected partitions follow the moving edge; openings keep their size.
Other wall separations may change if they stay at least 0.30 m; no new same-floor
near parallel lines, sub-0.60 m room portions or changed hosts/connections may result.
Near stacked faces align in Z while preserving declared storey heights. Add
elevation_reference:true only for an explicit trusted base annotation; a
conflict with that elevation rejects instead of silently changing it. Full
before/after coordinates, reasons and failures are saved with the assembly.
To change a layer's height first use revise_plan_bim set ceiling_height; opening
z pairs must still fit and need separate, justified edits if they change. An
upper draft can already use its final absolute z, or use local z with base zero;
never add the floor base twice. Heights/evidence are caller declarations, not
verified image truth. Assembly does not infer stairs, merge vertical spaces,
or create vertical connections. For genuinely continuous spaces use the shared
geometry representation explicitly instead of stacking rooms with false slabs.
Include ALL intended floors when reassembling revised drafts. New assembly
rebuilds from those drafts and does not carry later candidate-only edits. Each
assembly is a new candidate; reviews of earlier candidates do not carry over.

set_space_role only changes the selected room's catalog role and role_evidence;
it preserves all geometry, IDs, openings, connections and geometry source notes.
Read room_types first. basis is observed for explicit input labels/declarations,
inferred for a plausible interpretation, including a broad use from building context
(requires nonempty assumptions). Prefer an inferred listed use over unknown; the fallback is
unknown paired with role=unknown. For observed/unknown, omitted assumptions become
an empty list; inferred still requires an explicit nonempty assumption. source_refs
must locate the evidence or explain its insufficiency. A later assignment replaces the active role_evidence and keeps
the old value in the edit history. Normal export updates public names and colors.
It does not establish drawing truth. Reconcile obsolete global notes explicitly.
remove_opening removes exactly one declared aperture by ID from windows or openings,
including a window that failed to build; its prior record remains in the edit audit.
Withdraw an inferred opening only with a reason; a host failure alone does not disprove
an observed opening. Normal rebuilding updates the saved unbuilt records.
add_opening preserves all existing objects; it supports doors/open apertures and
requires a new ID. World z is absolute, including on upper floors. Normal source
validation rejects wrong/ambiguous hosts, overlaps or out-of-floor heights.
For an inherited geometry.unsupported entry of kind as_drawn_opening_unbuilt,
read exact records with read_candidate_items(collection="unsupported");
after adding or identifying its actual door, explicitly use
{"op":"resolve_unbuilt_observation","input_id":"plan",
 "observation_ids":["old-face-gap"],"opening_ids":["new_D2"],
 "reason":"explain original-image correspondence","source_refs":["plan: observation"]}.
input_id/observation_ids must exactly match one saved entry. Replacement openings
must exist on that floor. Multiple face observations may map to one physical door
only with drawing evidence; do not count them as separate doors. The old record
remains in corrections. This records your interpretation, not an independent pass.
Combine addition and resolution in one revision when appropriate. Unresolved
observations must remain; do not clear them merely to pass a check.
Reflect transforms the entire proposal around the footprint midpoint on that
axis, including rooms, window directions/spans and door coordinates. It preserves
identities and connectivity. Replace stale directional assumptions with set_notes.
Source IDs remain stable even if they contain an obsolete direction in their name.
move_shared_wall is a local operation for two same-floor rectangular cells
sharing one complete edge. It derives the wall axis from their existing geometry
and moves both sides to coordinate_m together; openings hosted between those
two cells move with the wall. Other objects retain their world coordinates and
are checked by the normal builder. Polygon cells, partial shared sides and
explicit enclosure declarations are unsupported by this edit; no new rooms or
walls are invented. Preserve image basis and check the resulting geometry.
replace_space_region takes space_id, neighbor_space_id, polygon, reason, source_refs.
It replaces one complete room and computes the adjacent room as the remainder of
their original union; both stay single hole-free spaces. It refuses third-space
encroachment, does not move apertures, and records before/after. Use explicit
update_opening operations in the same revision when hosts or positions change.
reshape_spaces replaces only the listed existing space polygons, deriving their
x/y bounds by code. It preserves other objects and NEVER moves or resizes an
opening. Update all affected adjoining spaces in one operation; include explicit
update_opening edits in the same revision where a moved host requires them.
Preserve the aperture's width/height unless new image evidence supports a change.
Normal source checks still reject overlaps and unhosted openings. This operation
rejects explicit enclosure declarations or nonempty wall reference/dimension
records; it does not add/remove spaces or remap wall evidence.
For edits not supported by revise_bim, submit a complete revised proposal with
build_bim, retaining the reliable geometry, IDs, source references and caveats.

To supersede obsolete text, include a local note replacement:
{"op":"replace_note", "field":"assumptions", "old":"Exact existing note",
 "replacement":["Updated statement limited to the inspected objects; others remain assumptions"],
 "reason":"What observation superseded this statement", "source_refs":["claim_0001"]}.
field can be assumptions or unresolved; replacement=[] explicitly withdraws that
one note with a reason. Old text must match exactly once. Unrelated notes survive,
the replacement enters source BIM and the old statement remains in audit history.
Use this in the SAME revision as the geometry correction when possible. Do not
leave a known false all-objects assumption in the saved source. Text associations
are model judgments, not automatic semantic verification of the replacement.

""",
    'wall_dimensions': """wall_placement compares saved wall dimensions with source wall positions
(tolerance: max 0.02 m or four original pixels per floor/axis, allowing two
pixels for each of two endpoint picks; coarse images can hide small offsets).
It names walls, labels and signed deviations relative
to the chain's first wall; unknown faces stay unassessed. Reports never move
geometry or certify the reading. Recheck mismatches against the original.

For an explicit wall position, check_wall_dimensions positions_json accepts:
[{"id":"pos-A","boundary_id":"<source wall ID>","axis":"x","lengths":[3000,2000],
"unit":"mm","origin_m":0,"direction":1,"node":1,"offset_m":0,
"basis":"annotation endpoint is the representative wall plane","source_refs":["plan.png: 3000 label"]}].
node selects cumulative endpoints (0 is origin). offset_m explicitly converts
that endpoint to the wall plane; unknown faces cannot be guessed. Results and
annotations are logged with the source hash. Repeat on revised candidates.

For wall thickness and annotation baselines, use check_wall_dimensions to list
actual source wall IDs, then calculate explicit endpoint conversions. Preserve
the representative room boundaries: offsets describe wall faces and do not move
rooms or openings. Do not assume an axis is centred or add half a wall thickness
to close a chain. Unknown offsets remain unknown even if total thickness is known.
Optional proposal fields wall_references and wall_dimensions persist these facts.
Prefer local edits of an existing record, retaining its original label/pixels and
the other records. A same-wall thickness label is a valid dimension observation,
not an invalid or redundant chain to delete merely because its sides conflict.
revise_bim operations:
{"op":"update_wall_dimension","id":"dim-A","changes":{"start":{"image":"plan.png"}},
"reason":"explain image evidence","source_refs":["plan.png: observed endpoint"]};
{"op":"update_wall_reference","id":"wall-A","changes":{"evidence_status":"inferred"},
"reason":"explain inferred scope","source_refs":["plan.png: observed versus inferred scope"]}.
Endpoint patches merge into the existing start/end, preserving untouched pixels,
wall_id and image. Other editable dimension fields are axis, direction, value and
unit; only change transcribed numbers when the original actually supports that.
Reference patches may change boundary_id, offsets_m, thickness_m, reference_basis,
thickness_scope or evidence_status. Keep derived output fields out of edits.
revise_bim also accepts {"op":"set_wall_references","wall_references":[...],
"wall_dimensions":[...],"reason":"image basis"}, replacing both whole lists.
Example wall reference (unrelated to supplied drawings):
{"id":"wall-A","boundary_id":"space/room/wall/1","offsets_m":[-0.08,0.16],
"thickness_m":0.24,"reference_basis":"declared representative axis; eccentric",
"thickness_scope":"unknown layer scope","evidence_status":"inferred",
"source_refs":["plan.png: local wall band observation or explicit assumption"]}.
offsets_m are signed along POSITIVE world x for a constant-x wall, or positive
world y for a constant-y wall, independent of which room owns the boundary.
Use offsets_m:null when unknown; thickness_m may also be null. Each reference
covers one complete straight source wall and its congruent counterpart. Partial
shared walls and explicit enclosure declarations are unsupported here. List only
local evidence you have; do not fill all walls with one guessed thickness.
Dimension example: {"id":"dim-A","axis":"x","direction":1,"value":5000,
"unit":"mm","start":{"wall_id":"wall-A","side":"positive","image":"plan.png",
"pixel":[100,200]},"end":{"wall_id":"wall-B","side":"negative",
"image":"plan.png","pixel":[500,200]},"source_refs":["plan.png: visible 5000 label"]}.
side is negative, positive, representative or unknown; axis labels count as
representative only if that correspondence is evidenced. Pixels are original
dimension extension endpoints. Pass dimensions in chain order only when related;
different wall sides are different chain endpoints. Tools preserve raw labels,
conversion terms and model residuals separately; they do not verify your reading.
Check endpoint pixels and world anchors describe the SAME face before calibrating.
Saved overlays show representative boundaries in magenta and declared wall faces
in blue, with observed/inferred/unknown status in metadata. A blue face is derived
from your claim, not independently detected. Geometry edits keep the representative
plane fixed for thickness updates; move_shared_wall carries attached face offsets
with the moved wall. Reflection with such evidence requires a full revised proposal.

Component thickness (a claims-bound edit; see claims for recording the value): inspect source wall/floor/ceiling boundary IDs via
check_wall_dimensions/include_inventory for walls, or existing source inventories.
revise_bim also accepts:
{"op":"set_component_thickness", "boundary_id":"space/room_A/wall/0",
 "thickness_m":{"claim":"claim_0002","value":"thickness"},
 "basis":"observed overall thickness; finishes included",
 "reason":"Preserve the explicit property without moving geometry"}.
The claim names this boundary. This updates optional component_attributes on a
new proposal/source; no space dimensions, opening geometry or level changes.
Shared full coincident sides receive ONE property record. Partial contacts and
open/unknown enclosure are not supported. Host identity is bound; later changing
that boundary requires explicit rebinding rather than silently reusing thickness.
""",
    'opening_review': """For a whole-floor plan review (without facade), use complete only after
inspecting ALL openings of that kind on that floor; use partial for a local check.
One mark represents one aperture/connection, not a crop with several doors.
Door swings, dimension ticks and window marks are different evidence. A note
saying one door does not remove a second modeled door. A review binds the reviewed
source; changed openings are unreviewed on the new candidate. Delivery retains current/old/unreviewed scopes;
prose cannot override those records. Do not fabricate marks to pass a checklist.

check_openings review_json example (unrelated to supplied drawings):
{"floor_id":"F1","kind":"door","image":"plan.png","coverage":"complete",
 "marks":[{"mark_id":"door-mark-1","box":[10,20,40,60],
 "opening_ids":["D1"],"space_ids":["room","hall"],"basis":"visible",
 "note":"one leaf and arc in a wall gap"}]}.
Use original-image pixels for box and enclose the entire observed aperture,
not only its label/arc. For registered plan images, both actual source endpoints
must fit the mark box; a mismatch is reported even if ID/kind/room all agree.
This checks location/containment, not exact width or visual truth. Without a
plan calibration, or for facade/elevation reviews, location_check says not_checked.
An exterior opening lists only its indoor
space ID in space_ids; never add an ID named 'outside' or 'outdoors'. Use no
opening_ids when an observed aperture has not been modeled. Separate paired
arcs serving different rooms into separate marks; a double-leaf door serving
one connection is one aperture. basis may be visible, inferred or uncertain.
The tool checks consistency with your observations, not their visual truth.
For an elevation review, add optional facade: North, South, East or West.
It limits coverage to exterior openings whose actual source host faces that
direction; a file name alone does not establish the physical facade. Complete
then means the WHOLE named facade for that floor/kind, not every facade on the
floor. Submit marks:[] when a fully inspected facade has no aperture of that
kind. All actual exterior directions, including zero-opening directions, need
complete reviews before facade reviews can cover a floor/kind. Interior or
unclassifiable openings stay explicitly uncovered. Without facade the original
whole-floor plan scope remains unchanged. Use partial for incomplete views.

""",
}

REFERENCES['partial_inference'] = """A method for completing a useful lightweight BIM
when the supplied exterior or mesh evidence does not reveal the whole building.
The model chooses the observations, architectural interpretation, level of detail
and revisions. Deterministic tools measure, expand repeated declarations, build
hosts, preserve IDs and report geometry; they do not choose the interpretation.

NATIVE MESH EVIDENCE. When inputs contains a mesh_input, inspect_mesh, view_mesh and
measure_mesh_pixels access the admitted ORIGINAL textured GLB. Choose cameras,
targets, spans and bounds for the uncertainty at hand; there is no required set of
screenshots. Query bounds before metric close-ups and measure visible surface pixels
instead of guessing scale. Mesh local coordinates are Z-up
[GLB.x,-GLB.z,GLB.y], optionally rotated in xy by an explicit yaw_degrees. Keep one
declared frame for construction and evidence. Prepared mesh views instead use their
supplied metric projection and explicit transform; local x/y need not be geographic
east/north.

inspect_mesh_directions returns area-weighted directions of selected near-vertical
triangles. These directions are surface evidence, not the yaw to apply. Parallel
directions retain quarter-turn and half-turn ambiguity; resolve orientation from
the whole asymmetric footprint, wings and identifiable faces. Pixel hits include
triangle normals and tilts. A point on a roof, slope or noisy remnant does not by
itself establish a wall edge. Compare independent surfaces, texture, local sections
and adjoining remnants before adopting a frame or missing volume.

The saved mesh-to-BIM relation is source XYZ =
rotate_xy(yaw)*original_Zup + translation_m. set_candidate_mesh_frame records it
on a new candidate; direct build_bim can declare the same mesh_frame with the mesh
hash, yaw, translation, reason and source references. A viewing camera supplies no
implicit frame. Translation cannot repair a wrong orientation. Frame correction
does not establish footprint, height, rooms or openings. revise_bim preserves the
frame, and obsolete frame notes must be explicitly replaced. overlay_mesh_candidate
projects the ACTUAL saved source edges onto a saved mesh view without fitting;
hidden edges are X-ray lines. Use suitable whole-building, side, top and local views
to distinguish orientation, displacement and shape errors.

OBSERVATION AND INFERENCE. Separate what the source shows, what it constrains, what
you infer, what you deliberately simplify and what remains unresolved. Missing or
cropped mesh surfaces are missing evidence, not proof of an opening, blank wall or
absent volume. A plausible completion may combine cut remnants, adjoining face
directions, texture, repeated facade patterns, local sections and architectural
context. State why the completion is preferred and retain viable uncertainty.
When several interpretations fit the available evidence equally well, prefer the
simpler useful one. Simplicity does not authorize dropping observed spaces, wall
strips, openings or building parts.

Use observed metric extents where they are reliable. Within noisy or incomplete
evidence, choose reasonable architectural dimensions and regularize consistently,
while labelling those values as inferred rather than measured. Save important
interpretations with record_inference. Its declaration contains statement, basis
(observed, inferred or simplified), reason and source_refs; optional object_refs
bind spaces, boundaries, openings or floors, and missing_information names evidence
that was unavailable. Observed records need a source reference; inferred or
simplified records need a source reference or explicit missing information.
inspect_inference reopens immutable records and their binding status. These records
keep evidence and assumptions close to affected source objects; they do not turn an
inference into an observation.

ARCHITECTURAL INTERPRETATION. First understand the relationship among the main
volume, wings, annexes, storeys, exceptional levels, roof forms and missing regions.
Exterior evidence constrains a plausible internal organization but rarely determines
one. Select the requested simplification directly: preserve actual physical rooms
and circulation that the chosen interpretation needs, and keep a continuous open
space intact when there is no proposed physical partition. Do not split rooms merely
by orientation, thermal convenience or rectangular decomposition.

Facade windows constrain room depth, bay rhythm and where partitions can meet the
exterior. Partition ends must respect observed apertures and intervening wall strips;
never clip, merge or swallow a window to make a room fit. For fine detail and a plausible
repeated enclosed-office layout, start from a room per structural bay/window group
when width and depth are usable. Larger multi-bay rooms need a use or spatial reason;
merging plausible separate rooms to reduce object count is a simplification to declare.
A window group is an aperture, not each pane. Visible open space, room use, circulation,
corner conditions and explicit user information can support a different layout.
Preserve exceptional windows rather than forcing every storey or facade into one template.

Assign common room types from get_bim_reference('room_types') using building context,
furniture or circulation where available. Prefer a plausible common type over
unknown when evidence supports one, but keep classification secondary to physical
spaces and connectivity. Do not label a large upper or roof volume as office merely
because it has floor area. Distinguish plausible occupied rooms, attic, mechanical
space, stair or lift continuations, shafts, cavities and geometry-only roof parts;
mark uncertain roof use as inferred or unresolved.

Vertical circulation and service cores may be continuous spaces through several
storeys when that interpretation fits the evidence. Model the continuous volume and
its actual contacts; surrounding room polygons exclude its footprint, while each
served storey includes it through explicit spanning_space_ids membership. Do not clone
the core per storey or insert fake intermediate slabs simply to fit a repeated-floor
template. Conversely, do not invent a continuous void when separate rooms or real
floors are supported.

Place doors from the intended circulation and the actual separating partition.
Choose a plausible entrance side before a position. Allow usable jamb or wall return,
door-leaf clearance and stair or landing clearance; repeated adjacent rooms may use
paired or consistently offset doors when appropriate. Do not mechanically select the
longest shared wall, put every door at its midpoint or use a fixed offset for every
building. A door connects already distinct spaces and must not substitute for a
missing or invented partition. Door sizes, states and positions without direct
evidence remain architectural inferences.

ASSEMBLY AND REVISION. build_parametric_bim can expand explicit storey/space
templates and aperture spans; read get_bim_reference('parametric') for its contract.
Repetition is a declared hypothesis, not evidence, and exceptions stay explicit.
A continuous core can be a separate tall instance referenced by the served storeys
through spanning_space_ids. build_bim remains available for geometry that does not fit the compact
template. Keep source references and stable IDs on observed and inferred objects.
When feedback exposes a host, boundary or interpretation error, revise that object
or its local declarations and preserve reliable geometry, openings and evidence.
Never shorten or delete an observed aperture merely to clear a host failure.

SOURCE REVIEW AND DELIVERY. Inspect the source that was actually saved, not only the
proposal or compact plan. Compare its overlays and views with the original evidence
for overall massing, levels, roof volumes, openings and preserved wall strips. Review
the internal result for physical partitions, usable room scale, continuous cores,
door hosts, circulation and the requested simplification. audit_inference_candidate
reports saved-source memberships, ranges, window distribution, door host/end
clearances and connectivity; it supplies no truth, code-compliance, threshold or
acceptance verdict. Use exact entity diffs when revising to verify the intended
objects changed and reliable objects did not. Geometry success, counts and a visually
plausible render do not prove fidelity. Deliver the saved source and viewable result
with observed, inferred, simplified and unresolved scope stated honestly.

  Pixels/anchor pixels may use {"profile":"profile_001","candidate":"C01","at":"start"}
  (also peak/end) from view_pixel_profile. Code checks original image/axis/hash.
  Ink candidates are not automatically physical walls or apertures.
For p1/p2 use a literal [x,y]; an image_axis interval is not a 2D point.

Supported references replace parameter values: update_window.z/span;
update_opening.z/p1/p2; move_shared_wall.coordinate_m (name both spaces);
add_opening.opening.p1/p2/z (name existing host spaces, both for an interior door);
and scalar polygon coordinates in reshape_spaces, e.g.
{"op":"reshape_spaces","spaces":[{"id":"room_A",
 "polygon":[[0,0],[{"claim":"$claim","value":"wall_x"},0],
 [{"claim":"$claim","value":"wall_x"},5],[0,5]]}],"reason":"Measured wall"}.
Keep unaffected coordinates literal, reference every changed occurrence, and
explicitly revise affected openings as usual. Source references are added by code.
Measured endpoints and assumed heights need separate claims; a plan source must
not masquerade as observed height. New identity/kind/connectivity are declarations.
Confirmation supports window/opening, shared-wall and reshape intents; every
confirmed parameter must be bound. A reshape confirmation therefore needs every
coordinate bound; use window/opening intents for ordinary height confirmation.

Optional value_targets maps EVERY value to the subset of declared objects it
supplies, e.g. {"wall_x":[{"kind":"space","id":"room_A"}],"face_interval":[]}.
[] denotes supporting evidence, never an applicable or missing parameter.
Without value_targets, every value targets every object. Do not conflate objects
or floors just because numbers match. Claims and originals remain immutable.
An unmodified target can inherit only along the actual candidate ancestry while
its geometry, physical host, source views and recomputed values remain unchanged.
The return names any changed item; handle unchanged targets separately and
reobserve changed ones. A notes/use-only change can retain physical observations.
A moved-then-restored target is conservatively invalid. No duplicate observation
is needed merely to change the parent hash. A confirmation is still required to
establish that an unapplied value matches the current parameter.

If only a source region is wrong, replace_claim_sources with actual view_ids and
a reason saves a new claim with the same objects/values and retracts the old one.
Adoption/confirmation does not transfer; inspect the new sources and transact its
new claim_id. If the interpretation/values change, record new evidence and use
action=decide, disposition=retracted for the obsolete claim. A wider view alone
does not change a saved narrow source.

For counts before or after BIM, use an entry with action=record and claim:
{"observation_type":"facade_count","image":"elevation.png","floor_id":"L1",
 "facade":"South","window_count":4,"reason":"Synthetic whole-facade count"}.
No candidate, decision or operations is needed for counts. Replace floor_id with
floor_plan_image before building. Optional box gives a source region; door_count
is separate. Include observed zero. Counts cover the WHOLE named floor/facade,
not just a crop. Re-record to correct the same scope; different images are
compared, never summed. facade_counts reports missing/conflicting totals and
unresolved scopes on saves/checks/delivery; matching counts prove no positions.

height_coverage lists evidenced/problem openings; other missing bindings are counted.
Full rows in details_file retain z, status, claim IDs and views.
Location needs that facade's explicit elevation calibration and a source
region containing this opening. A region containing several openings is marked
needs_per_opening_confirmation, even when numbers match; narrow/replace the
source with each opening's own evidence. Internal heights remain in the source
inventory. Status is not proof that a dimension chain was read correctly.

claim_status(candidate) reports confirmed_unchanged, applied_current,
pending_application, partially_satisfied, changed_since_check and decisions,
with missing bindings and unresolved evidence. Other branches stay separate;
imported prior-run applications are inherited/not rechecked. claim_status()
returns history. A failed edit keeps its parent and audit; a failed source
candidate may remain for inspection. Unbound geometry is untracked, not thereby
wrong. finish_bim preserves execution failures and adopted-but-unapplied evidence.
