"""Offline process metrics for a reading artifact — no gt, no LLM, no run.

``reading_regression.py`` answers "did this run score well?", which requires a
paid run to have happened first. This answers a different question that until
now had no answer at all:

    Looking only at the reader's own output, did it MEASURE, or did it eyeball?

Every metric here is computed from ``0_reading/*_view.json`` alone. That makes
it usable in three places a score cannot reach:

  1. as a gate on a fresh reading, before anything downstream runs;
  2. as a discriminating-power test for any NEW reading rule — run it over
     ``case_tests/test_baseline/reading_fixtures.json`` and require that every
     ``good`` fixture stays green while at least one ``bad`` fixture goes red;
  3. as a diagnosis, because each metric names the specific discipline that
     slipped rather than reporting one undifferentiated bad score.

The metric set comes from dissecting the five good historical readings against
the nine bad ones (2026-08-21). Note deliberately that NO single metric
separates all good from all bad: 07-02 scored 9/9 with zero pixel anchors, and
D1 failed with 100% chain-explainable coordinates. Good readings are several
disciplines holding at once, so the value is in the profile, not any one number.
