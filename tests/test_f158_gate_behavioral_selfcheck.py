"""F-158 甲案 — a resident BEHAVIOURAL self-check that the no-billed-calls egress
gate is actually live in *this* pytest process.

Where the other F-158 locks sit
--------------------------------
* ``tests/test_no_billed_provider_calls.py`` pins the gate's *mechanism* while
  it is known to be installed (raw socket / create_connection / urllib all get
  ``ProviderCallBlocked``).
* ``tests/test_f158_early_gate_regression.py`` reproduces, in a child process,
  the pre-parse bypass carriers the cross-family review found, and (see the
  ``teeth`` lock there) proves *this* self-check flips red when the gate is off.

This file asks a blunter question at run time, in-process:

    right now, does an actual outbound connection get stopped by the gate?

It opens a real socket to RFC 5737 TEST-NET-1 (``192.0.2.1`` — guaranteed
non-routable, never a provider) with a short timeout and NO proxy (a raw
``socket.connect`` goes straight to the IP and never consults ``*_proxy`` env
vars) and asserts the attempt is turned into ``ProviderCallBlocked``.

Why a behaviour probe and NOT a flag read
-----------------------------------------
It deliberately does **not** read ``ep_no_billed_gate._INSTALLED`` — that flag is
a *proxy* for "the gate says it is installed". We measure the thing that
actually matters: "the gate really intercepts egress".

It is equally deliberate that this module does **not** ``import
ep_no_billed_gate`` at top level. Importing that module runs ``_install()`` and
arms the gate — which would mask exactly the runs we want to catch (a startup
config that left the gate OFF: ``-o addopts=``, a ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` override,
``-c <other config>``, dropping ``-p ep_no_billed_gate``, a foreign rootdir with
no ``tests/conftest.py``, …). The blocking exception is therefore identified by
class name/module, without importing anything.

Honest scope (see T2 note in ``ep_no_billed_gate`` docstring)
------------------------------------------------------------
This is a **detector, not an interceptor**. A test that runs *before* this one
in the same process and truly reached the network has already spent the money;
this only guarantees you will *see red* for a run whose gate was off. It is a
backstop that depends on none of the wiring (addopts pin / conftest re-import /
import-time self-install) — it observes behaviour directly.
