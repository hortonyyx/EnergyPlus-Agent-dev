"""Prototype: ink-dialect separation + annotation calibration + opening band scan.

Built during the 2026-08-22 orchestrator hands-on run. Purpose is to replace three
reading steps that were previously human judgement:

  1. "which ink is structure / fenestration / annotation"  -> measured, declared
  2. "where does the drawing say 5000 mm is"                -> witness ticks + LSQ fit
  3. "is this band segment a window or a wall pier"         -> ink family inside band

(3) is the F-69 killer. The existing `clean_vector_v1` recipe masks only
R~=G~=B ink, so the entire fenestration layer (12.3% of sm25 1f ink) is
structurally invisible to every existing probe -- the reader could not measure
openings, only infer them from gaps in the wall face lines. It inferred
correctly on the north wall and inverted on the east wall. Not a judgement
failure; a missing observable.

Degradation is explicit, never silent: a monochrome drawing (sm20: 100% gray)
reports mode="monochrome" and marks every band segment polarity_ambiguous, so
the caller knows the colour cue is unavailable rather than getting a confident
wrong answer.
