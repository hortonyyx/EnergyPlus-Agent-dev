"""Per-stage deterministic check adapters + the common CheckReport v2 schema.

Each module here is a thin *stage adapter*: it knows how to turn a stage's
artifact into a :class:`CheckReport` (facts), reusing the low-level domain
validators in ``src/validator/{interzone,schedules,data_model}.py`` and
``src/validator/idf_fragments.py`` rather than re-implementing parsing/regex.
Policy (block vs flag) lives in :mod:`schema` as a pure function of the facts.
