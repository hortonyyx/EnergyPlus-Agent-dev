"""S0 — 0_reading deterministic structure linter (M2a, gate ①).

Per contracts §1 0_reading and the pen library, this is a *per-image* linter: it
asks only "is this one drawing structurally well-formed and self-consistent",
never topology / cross-image placement (those belong to 1_correction). The one
world-placement datum it does look at is the plan's own ``scale_origin`` — a
per-image declaration of how that drawing's local frame sits in the single world
frame, required by guide.md §1 and consumed by gate②; it assigns no rooms,
surfaces or facades, so the no-topology discipline is intact.

Layers (§0.2):
  - INVARIANT (block): unique stroke/dimension ids, legal pen × kind for the
    image_kind, finite numerics, non-degenerate line/rect, parseable dimensions,
    axis-endpoint consistency, image-local facade fields present on elevations,
    uncaptured present as a list (NOT required non-empty — clean drawing → []).
  - CROSS_CHECK (flag): single-image dimension-chain closure (Σ segments ==
    overall), low-confidence internal stroke↔dimension consistency, out-of-bounds.
  - CROSS_CHECK, profile-gated to BLOCK under golden/regression: plan
    ``scale_origin`` usable (see :func:`_plan_scale_origin`).

Returns a :class:`CheckReport`; policy (block vs flag) is applied by the report.

    """B-1 (r3 batchC dispatch §1 BLOCKER, route (b) — unit-anomaly, no
    external root): the dimensionally-safe replacement for the retired r2 X-2
    mechanism (``resolve_view_pixel_bounds`` + ``trusted_image_bounds``),
    which compared a METRE reading coordinate against a PIXEL bound (the
    case_data source image's real width/height in px). A ~10-20 m building's
    source image is 790-3000 px wide, so virtually any garbage metre-scale
    value up to that pixel count — including the exact repro payload
    ``[360, 450]`` — sailed straight through: the regression gate blocked
    nothing on real case_data images, only on the retired test suite's 2x2 px
    synthetic fixture. See sol's 2026-08-04 batch C r2 review §2 for the full
    repro.

    Route (a) — deriving a metre bound from a pixel-per-metre ratio (e.g. the
    view's own ``scale_origin`` / dimension calibration) — was rejected: that
    ratio is itself written by the party being checked (``scale_origin`` is a
    plain product-declared dict, see ``_plan_scale_origin``; no other
    pixel-per-metre source exists anywhere in this repository — grepped for
    print/paper-scale case metadata, found none), which fails
    decision_log.md §5.14's "the judged party cannot write the basis" test
    exactly the way the original bug did.

    Route (b), implemented here, asks a dimensionally-consistent question
    entirely within metre space: is this coordinate's magnitude sane relative
    to the SAME view's own already-established structural geometry? This is
    an established pattern in this file already (``_chain_closure``,
    ``_stroke_dimension_consistency`` are both internal cross-consistency
    checks over the same submission, not comparisons to a frozen external
    fact) — it does not need decision_log §5.14's "second, pre-existing,
    unwritable record" because it is not freezing a value at all; it is a
    fixed, gate①-owned ALGORITHM (which the checked party cannot write —
    it lives in this module, not in the submission) applied to the party's
    own data. What the party CANNOT do is defeat it by writing one bad
    coordinate: to slip a pixel-scale value past this fence, the whole
    submission's stroke geometry would have to be uniformly pixel-scale too,
    at which point ``_chain_closure``/``_dimension_derived_refs`` and the
    plan/elevation dimension-chain checks would very likely also fire on the
    same submission (the injected value would no longer be an isolated
    anomaly, it would be systemic).

    Uses STROKES ONLY (line/rect/polyline geometry) — never OCR anchors, never
    dimension endpoints, never the product-declared ``image_bounds`` escape
    hatch (``_explicit_image_bounds`` is not consulted here) — because those
    are exactly the fields these two checks judge; consulting them would let
    the party being checked inflate its own yardstick. This is the same
    concern the r1/r2 "three inflation tricks" test targeted, and it is still
    resisted: dropping the product-declared ``image_bounds`` field and
    dimension endpoints from the point set entirely defeats two of the three
    tricks by construction (they are never read); the third (an added stray
    stroke reaching toward the bad anchor) is resisted by using MEDIAN +
    MEDIAN ABSOLUTE DEVIATION (MAD), not raw min/max, as the base statistic —
    a robust statistic barely moves when one extra point is injected among
    several genuine ones (a raw min/max bounding box has no such property: one
    extra point can move a max arbitrarily far). Worked example (batch C r3
    execution log has the full numeric trace): a 2-stroke base building
    (points (0,0),(10,0),(0,8),(10,8)) plus one injected stroke reaching to
    (400,500) still yields median_x=5, MAD_x=5 — unchanged from the
    non-injected case — because a single outlier among several points does
    not move the median.

    Returns ``None`` when the view has no stroke geometry at all (degenerate/
    empty submission) — callers then fail closed (every OCR anchor / dimension
    endpoint is flagged "no structural geometry to judge against"), the same
    fail-closed posture the pre-B-1 code had for its own "no bounds" case.

    ⚠️ 2026-08-04 r4 (batch C dispatch §1, user-ratified downgrade — KNOWN
    LIMITATIONS, written on purpose so this does not quietly become "the
    check that claims to guard something it can't"):
      - False NEGATIVE: if the whole view's stroke geometry is itself written
        in pixel space (not just one bad coordinate), the median/MAD fence is
        computed FROM that pixel-scale geometry, so a pixel-scale OCR anchor
        or dimension endpoint is no longer an outlier relative to it and
        passes clean. The worked-example resistance to the "stray stroke"
        trick above only holds when the REST of the geometry is genuinely
        metre-scale.
      - False POSITIVE: the median can degenerate on ordinary, everyday
        shapes. A closed polyline that repeats its start point as its last
        point (a common "closed room outline" encoding) pulls the median
        toward that repeated corner instead of the room's centre — e.g. a
        legitimate 10x8 m room ((0,0),(10,0),(10,8),(0,8),(0,0)) yields
        median_x=0 (not 5) and a collapsed MAD, fencing METRE-SCALE ANNOTATIONS
        INSIDE THE SAME ROOM outside the tolerated band. The same collapse
        hits a 60x4 m elongated building. Both shapes are exercised as real
        locks in tests/test_checks_reading_correction.py.
      - Route (a) (a pixel-per-metre ratio from ``scale_origin``) was already
        rejected (see the paragraph above) because the judged party writes
        that ratio; route (b) here is dependency-free but, as the two failure
        modes above show, is not a reliable arbiter either — it is a
        heuristic, not a proof.
      ⇒ Both consumers (``_ocr_anchors_in_bounds`` /
      ``_dimension_endpoints_in_bounds``) treat this fence as ADVISORY ONLY
      (disposition FLAG, never BLOCK — see schema.py) as of r4. Do not re-BLOCK
      on this fence without first fixing the mechanism itself. The intended
      real fix is R1.5 (reading writes pixel anchors + a referenced dimension
      only; metric conversion happens exactly once, in code — eliminating the
      "is this coordinate secretly in the wrong unit" question by
      construction instead of guessing at it statistically after the fact)."""
