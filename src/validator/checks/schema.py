"""CheckReport v2 — the common schema every per-stage deterministic check emits.

Two ideas drive the design, both from the 2026-06-15 validation architecture
(see AI_agent/architecture/pipeline_stage_contracts.md §0.2/§0.4):

1. **Three layers** (§0.2). Every check declares which layer it belongs to:
     - ``invariant``   — a structural/geometric invariant that MUST hold; a
                         failure is a bug or fatal. Maps to BLOCK.
     - ``cross_check`` — reconciliation against an upstream constraint / another
                         channel / a plausibility band; a failure is a surface
                         for attribution, not a stop. Maps to FLAG.
     - ``perceptual``  — a faithfulness call deterministic code cannot make;
                         handled by a human / VLM judge. Not produced here.

2. **Policy ≠ fact** (§0.4 #8). A check emits a *fact*: ``CheckResult`` with a
   status and machine-readable evidence. Whether a failing fact *blocks* is a
   *policy* decision derived from ``(layer, status, capability_profile)`` by
   :func:`disposition` — kept a pure function so the same fact can map
   differently under different profiles. A check that does not apply under the
   active profile emits ``not_applicable`` (e.g. the rectangular-coverage check
   under a non-rectangular profile), so blocking stays profile-aware without the
   check itself knowing the policy.

The report carries the ``artifact_hash`` / ``attempt_hash`` it was computed
against so an accepted attempt's checks are auditable after the fact (M0
append-only attempts), plus ``check_version`` for golden-test stability.

# 2026-08-04 r4 (batch C dispatch §1, user-ratified downgrade): this used to BLOCK

# ``src.validator.checks.reading._structural_metric_reference`` (median/MAD over
# a view's own stroke geometry). Independent sol review + orchestrator live
# testing found that fence is NOT reliable in either direction:
#   - false NEGATIVE: a structure written entirely in pixel space (so the bad
#     coordinate is no longer an outlier relative to its own geometry) sails
#     straight through — the exact shape the check exists to catch.
#   - false POSITIVE (the more dangerous one): an ordinary 10x8 m closed-
#     polyline room, or a 60x4 m elongated building, with perfectly legitimate
#     annotations, gets FAILED — the robust statistic degenerates on these
#     everyday shapes (see tests/test_checks_reading_correction.py's two r4
#     "real shape, must not be blocked" locks for the worked repro).
# ⇒ downgraded to ADVISORY ONLY: never in ``blocking()``, on any profile,
# including golden/regression. The FAIL fact + evidence (offenders /
# structural_reference) are still produced — nothing here is deleted or
# silently swallowed, only kept out of the blocking set. This is a stopgap;
# the structural fix is R1.5 (reading only ever writes pixel anchors +
# referenced dimensions, metric conversion lives solely in code so "pixel
# mistaken for metre" becomes constructionally impossible instead of
# something a heuristic has to guess at after the fact).

# "exploratory"/"dev" because THOSE PROFILES are intentionally soft; this one
# is lenient on every profile — including golden/regression — because the
# CHECK ITSELF is known unreliable in both directions (see the false-negative/
# false-positive account immediately above). Flipping this to a permissive
# whitelist of the four profiles known today would silently make a future,
# stricter 5th profile BLOCK on this exact heuristic by default — reintroducing
# the false-positive-fails-correct-buildings defect the 2026-08-04 downgrade
# was written to remove, for any run adopting that profile before R1.5 lands.
# Left as an always-empty block set (⇒ FLAG on every profile, present or
# future) until the structural fix (R1.5) replaces the heuristic; flagged for
# orchestrator review in the 2026-08-08 execution log rather than silently
# reinterpreted, since this is a case where the general "new strict profile
# defaults to strict" rule and this check's own documented "advisory on any
