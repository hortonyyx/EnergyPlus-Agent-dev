"""Staged intake pipeline: reading-stage vector JSON -> IntakeOutput.

The reading stage (0_reading: image -> semantic vector JSON) is image-bound and
half-manual; this module runs everything after it, image-blind, as ordered
stages each independently swappable and with a verifiable / diffable intermediate:

  1_correction      CORRECTION (LLM)   vectors + correction docs -> CorrectedGeometry
  core              DETERMINISTIC      canonical axis snap + sliver guard (code)
  2_modelling +     GEOMETRY (code)    CorrectedGeometry -> BuildingGeometry, then
  3_split_pairing                      serialized to zone/surface/fenestration specs
  4_mep             PHYSICS (LLM)      the 8 non-geometry IntakeOutput fields
  5_intakeoutput    ASSEMBLY (code)    stitch geometry + MEP specs -> IntakeOutput

The CorrectedGeometry checkpoint is materialized (correction_geometry*.json) so the
correction error budget is separable, and the deterministic core guarantees no
cross-floor sliver reaches EnergyPlus. Geometry is fully deterministic (the kernel
builds + serializes it); the LLM does only correction judgment (1_correction) and
physics semantics (4_mep).

This module is the single implementation. It is called from:
  - `intake_node` (the main graph), and
  - `scripts/run_pipeline_deepseek.py` (thin standalone CLI wrapper).

Per-stage model config: `intake_correction` / `intake_mep` in llm.yaml if present,
else fall back to `intake_correction` (so "model switching has one home" still
holds). Why a raw OpenAI client instead of langchain: single-shot calls with
DeepSeek thinking on; langchain's structured-output burns tokens on
reasoning_content and never emits the tool call, so we ask for JSON-only content
and parse it ourselves.

    reading view takes the legacy adapter (its ``image_kind`` decides
    plan/elevation).  Anything else — a v0 prototype, an unknown or damaged

    record says which source was used; a fixture result is never reported

    ``projection`` (B1 wiring): when given AND the outcome is a success,
    the chain also drives the projection bridge over the final wall
    compilation and files ``projection_envelope.json`` next to the outcome
    (the return type is unchanged — the envelope is the on-disk product).

    ``draw_validate`` is the inner-retry validator (a failure re-issues the LLM call
    up to ``attempts`` times). Default = the full ``_make_correction_validator``
    (legacy ``run_pipeline`` path: schema + semantic). Pass
    ``_schema_only_correction_validator`` (stepwise mode) so the inner retry handles
    only schema/format, leaving semantic draw quality to gate① (so a content-bad
    draw is counted + filed as an attempt, not silently re-drawn). Pass ``None`` to
    disable the inner validator entirely.

    ⭐ Module 7 (2026-09-02): ``evidence_chain=True`` switches this stage onto
    the evidence chain (frozen bytes → adapter → compiler → decision packet →
    model beat → decision loop).  The switch is EXPLICIT and one-way: the
    pasted-JSON prompt below is not built at all in that mode.

    ⭐ B1 wiring (2026-09-03): a SUCCESSFUL chain outcome is projected by the
    projection bridge into the returned ``CorrectedGeometry`` (subclass
    ``CorrectedGeometryV3``), with the whole product — ``footprint_provenance=
    "derived_from_walls"`` and the binding hash — filed as
    ``projection_envelope.json`` under ``out_dir`` (both required in this
    mode).  ``evidence_chain_z_floor_m`` / ``evidence_chain_ceiling_height_m``
    must be declared by the caller: the bridge never mints a z (B2 owns
    sourcing).  When the loop does NOT succeed there is still no product:
    ``EvidenceChainTerminal`` fires — the final provisional is audit-only
    and ⛔ must never travel as one.  A successful but ``degraded`` envelope
    is returned only for the exploratory evidence-chain profile; the strict
    profile refuses it here, before geometry can reach the judge."""

    (a): code owns these 3 names outright rather than heuristically guessing
    which of the model's schedules is "the" heating setpoint) — plus their
    2 reserved ScheduleTypeLimits — to the LLM-authored schedule_specs text.

    2026-08-14 terra cross-review, 1st pass finding: the prompt tells the
    model not to author these 3 schedules, but the prompt is not a
    constraint (this repo's own model-visible-but-not-its-business lesson)
    — a model response can still define a Schedule:Compact under one of the
    3 reserved names. Fixed by TRUE code ownership: any Schedule:Compact in
    ``schedule_specs`` whose name matches one of the 3 reserved names —
    compared case-INSENSITIVELY, since EnergyPlus object-name lookups are
    case-insensitive — is excluded (via eppy ``removeidfobject`` +
    ``idfstr()`` re-serialization, not string surgery) before the code's
    canonical definition is appended.

    2026-08-14 terra cross-review, 2nd pass finding: the 1st-pass fix left
    the 3 canonical schedules referencing the GENERIC ScheduleTypeLimits
    names Temperature / OnOff, only adding the code's definition when the
    model hadn't already defined that name — a deliberate choice to avoid
    tampering with unrelated model schedules that might share those names.
    But it meant the 3 "code-owned" schedules still depended on something
    the MODEL fully controlled: a model response narrowing Temperature to
    e.g. `30, 40` silently put the code's own 20/24 values out of range
    (check_mep does not catch this — terra reproduced it, all of
    mep.idf_parse / mep.schedule_type_refs / mep.schedule_completeness /
    mep.hvac_schedule_refs PASS, check_mep.passed=True), and a model
    response spelling it lower-case `temperature` made the merge's
    case-insensitive "already defined" check skip adding `Temperature`
    while the canonical schedules still spelled it exact-case — and this
    repo's mep.schedule_type_refs is a case-SENSITIVE set comparison, so
    that combination made mep.schedule_type_refs FAIL for both canonical
    schedules (terra reproduced this too; a regression THIS rework
    introduced, not a pre-existing gap).

    Fixed by giving the 3 reserved schedules their own 2 EXCLUSIVE
    ScheduleTypeLimits names (HVACDet_Temperature / HVACDet_OnOff — see the
    constants block above) instead of the generic ones, and applying
    EXACTLY the same code-ownership treatment used for the 3 schedule names
    (case-insensitive exclusion of any same-named model definition, then
    the code's own canonical definition is appended unconditionally — no
    "only if the model hasn't defined it" branch anymore, because nothing
    legitimate can ever define these reserved names). The model's own
    generic Temperature / OnOff — if it defines them for something else,
    e.g. a people/lights schedule — are now completely untouched by this
    function: there is no longer any name for them to collide with, so the
    original motive (don't tamper with unrelated model schedules) is
    preserved without the code's own values depending on the model's.

    Only reformats (re-serializes via idfstr()) when a collision actually
    exists — the common case (no collision on either the 3 schedule names
    or the 2 type-limit names) leaves ``schedule_specs`` byte-identical
    apart from the appended addendum.

    Unconditional otherwise: this runs even if ``schedule_specs`` fails to
    parse — nothing can be reliably excluded from unparseable text, but the
    concatenated MEP bundle will still fail mep.idf_parse (fail-closed, same
    as before this change), so this is not a silent gap.

    The model may separately still define ITS OWN heating/cooling/hvac
    schedules under names other than the 3 reserved ones (authoring.md and
    the system prompt now tell it not to, but that is a token-saving
    instruction, not an enforced constraint) — those become orphaned
    (defined, unreferenced). No check in this repo flags orphaned schedules
    (grep for unused/orphan/unreferenced in checks/mep.py and
    validator/schedules.py is empty), so this is silent by omission, not
    silently wrong — recorded here and in the dispatch report, not hidden."""
