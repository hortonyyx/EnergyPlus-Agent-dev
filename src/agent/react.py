2026-08-13, F-25 — bounded retry, not blind.

Downstream 9-subagent tool-calling loops (`build_react_agent`) had zero
resilience: one provider-side failure on any turn propagated uncaught all the
way through `run_downstream_ep`, killing the entire flow with no retry and no
diagnosable evidence (unlike 1_correction/4_mep, whose single-shot raw-OpenAI
calls already retry via `pipeline.py::_call_json_llm`, and unlike the outer
stage-attempt loop, which redraws a whole stage on gate① rejection). This
mirrors that same idea one layer down, for the LLM<->tool transport itself.
Not blind: `_enforce_single_tool_call` below removes the actual confirmed
trigger (provider batching many tool_calls into one turn despite
`parallel_tool_calls=False`) BEFORE a retry is ever needed; this retry only
covers residual transient provider/transport failures.
