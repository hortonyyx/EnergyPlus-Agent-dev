"""0_reading vector-JSON schema (M1: P1a dimension chain + P1b facade image-local).

The reading stage retraces each drawing into a semantic vector JSON. This module
is the canonical Pydantic model for that artifact. Two M1 schema changes over the
legacy shape (see build plan §M1):

**P1a — dimension chain + provenance.** Each ``Dimension`` gains
``chain_id / role(overall|segment|baseline) / order / value_m / text_verbatim /
anchor`` so the dimension-chain-closure check (Σ segments == overall) can run and
so the literal OCR text is preserved verbatim for the judge's "number copied
wrong" rubric (transcription truth lives here, not in a parsed float).

**P1b — facade is image-local only.** An elevation declares ``view_facade`` (which
facade, from the trusted image name/metadata), ``local_x_positive`` (a purely
in-image convention — NEVER east/west), ``mirrored``, and structured
``orientation_evidence``. World axis / sign / base are NOT here — 1_correction
derives them. The legacy free-text ``facade_axis_note`` is retained for the
migration adapter (legacy.py) but is not load-bearing.

``extra="allow"`` everywhere keeps older artifacts loadable; the deterministic
linter (validator/checks/reading.py) enforces the real invariants.
