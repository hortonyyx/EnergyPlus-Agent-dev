"""Per-FILE contract discriminator for the 0_reading vector directory (F-97).

``src/agent/reading/contract.py`` recognizes the reading-product **envelope**
(``{"views": {...}}``).  This module answers a different question, one file at a
time: *given one parsed JSON found in a run's ``0_reading/``, which declared
contract is it, and may 1_correction consume it?*

Why this exists
---------------
``discover_vector_files`` sorts ``0_reading/*.json`` into plans / elevations /
**others**, and the correction prompt pasted every one of them in verbatim.  A
JSON of any shape whatsoever therefore reached the model as untyped text without
passing a single reading gate (F-97).  ⛔ The filename regex is an ORDERING key,
never a contract: ``1f_view_checks.json`` is a check report, not a reading view.

Discipline this module follows
------------------------------
1. ⭐ **The as-drawn schema value is imported from its producer**, never copied.
   ``as_drawn_v2.SCHEMA`` is the one place that string is defined; a literal here
   would be a second definition that silently stops matching the day the
   producer's value changes.  Same lesson as ``judge/as_drawn/denominator.py:14``
   ("⛔ never from a second re-implementation ... a check whose recomputation
   does not mirror the producer's definition measures the difference between two
   opinions").
2. ⭐ **A contract is a (declared schema value × required key set) PAIR**, not a
   schema value alone.  ``as_drawn_plan_v2`` is emitted by two different
   producers with two different shapes (the reading product, and the as-drawn
   check report from ``validator/checks/as_drawn.py``), so keying on the value
   alone would name one of them the other.
3. ⭐ **Every contract is recognized by its producer's own TYPE**, never by a key
   list induced from existing artifacts.  Legacy views use
   ``reading/schema.py:ReadingView`` plus the field correction actually eats,
   ``strokes`` (the prompt cites stroke ids and counts ``pen == "window"``);
   check-report sidecars use ``validator/checks/schema.py:CheckReport``.
   ⚠️ Both models default every field, so they validate ``{}`` — "parses"
   alone would recognize everything, hence the explicit-key conjuncts.
4. ⭐ **Every detector is evaluated; first-match-wins is forbidden.**  Two
   matches is an ambiguity to report, not a race for the detector that ran first.
5. ⭐ **Structural fallback is only for the undeclared.**  Legacy recognition
   exists for artifacts written before ``schema`` did.  A file that declares a
   ``schema`` **at all** is unknown unless the declaration lands on a registered
   contract *including that contract's key set* — even when the file still looks
   like a reading view.  Otherwise any future contract that kept a ``strokes``
   list would be silently consumed as a 2026-06 view, which is F-97 reopened in
   a new shape.
   ⚠️ "Declares something this module cannot honour" has **three** shapes and
   all three are unknown: an unregistered value, a *registered* value whose
   required keys are absent (BLK-A), and a non-string value (BLK-C).  A file
   declaring a registered value **and** satisfying that contract's key set
   **and** matching legacy structure is a genuine double match and still goes to
   #4's ambiguity path — ⛔ collapsing that one into a single verdict is the
   failure mode this very fix nearly caused, twice.
6. ⭐ **Classifying a file is never allowed to raise.**  Every entry point here
   is upstream of the consumption ledger, so an exception escaping this module
   destroys the record that was supposed to name the offender — the ledger is
   then missing precisely for the runs it exists to explain.  ⛔ The defence is a
   boundary, not an enumeration of exception types (an enumeration can never be
   finished): unreadable path, undecodable bytes and unparsable text each get a
   specific named row, and anything else at all is caught by a last-resort net
   that still produces a named ``unknown/error`` row plus an offender.  Loud and
   on the books either way.
