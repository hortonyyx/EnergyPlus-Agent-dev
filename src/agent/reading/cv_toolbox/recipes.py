"""Single source for CV toolbox recipe constants.

2026-08-19: the prescan macro recipes (``prescan_plan`` / ``prescan_elevation``) and
their ~840 lines of candidate-generation machinery were WITHDRAWN FROM THE WORKING
TREE on the user's ruling ("从现在的工作环境撤掉，不是说就永远不要了"). They had been in a half-dead state since
2026-08-15: the implementation was still here while the authorization table
(``run_cv_probe.ALLOWED_TOOLS``) no longer listed them, so the reader could not call
them at all and only the orchestrator could pre-stage their output. Nothing was lost: the full code, tests and restore
procedure are archived under ``AI_agent/capability/reading/prescan_snapshot/``
(byte-identical to commit 0cfa289). Whether prescan comes back — and in what form —
is a reading-专项 decision, to be taken together with the "calibration anchors must be
a tool-emitted candidate_id" fix, because prescan's tick_candidate is exactly the
machine-detected tick source that fix needs.
