"""Judge verdict schema v2 (M3, contracts §0.3 gate ②).

A judge verdict is a STRUCTURED CHECKLIST, not a numeric score (this project is
qualitative > quantitative). Each rubric criterion gets a status + evidence; the
verdict also carries attribution fields the orchestrator uses to route:

  - ``root_stage`` / ``root_confidence``: which stage the judge believes is the
    root cause, and how sure. ``root_stage=None`` or low confidence ⇒ NOT
    auto-routed (contracts §0.3: "unknown 不得自动路由").
  - ``retriable``: whether a blind resample could plausibly fix it.

Criterion statuses include ``not_applicable`` and ``insufficient_evidence`` so a
judge can decline to rule rather than guess (design L2). A verdict blocks the
stage when any criterion is SEVERE or FATAL; MINOR flags but passes.
