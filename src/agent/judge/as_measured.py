"""``AsMeasuredV1`` -- the first of the facts layer's three cuts.

    as_measured  +  revisions  =>  as_signed        (architecture/gt_revision_ledger.md §一)
    ^^^^^^^^^^^ THIS FILE.  ⛔ ``revisions`` / ``as_signed`` are ②-1b, not here.

⭐ WHAT IT IS: what the machine measured off the **un-retouched** drawing.
⛔ WHAT IT IS NOT: an answer.  Nothing here is projected, expanded, or given a
modelling ``basis``; ⛔ this file does not know what an outer skin is.

## Projection choices it deliberately does NOT store

1. ``basis`` -- axis vs outer-skin is a CHOICE MADE WHEN COMPILING AN ANSWER
   (guide §十.6b), not something a drawing can be measured for.  ⇒ ②-1c.
2. **expanded endpoints** -- F-122 measured that the S7 zone-edge report's
   per-edge endpoints are the answer edges AFTER S7 pushed them out by t or t/2
   (``offset_m == (t if outer_skin else t/2)``, 136/136; all 272 endpoints
   already 0.060-0.339 m outside their claimed cavity).  Copying them in would
   be a semantic reverse-migration, and any compiler then validated against
   them would only replay the producer's own choice.
``boundary_condition`` is now a first-class, cavity-side edge fact (②-1d).
It is derived before any answer-profile offset is selected and independently
rechecked by the answer compiler; it is not copied from stored ``basis``.

⭐ Consequently the source of every field here is **P1 (S0-S4)**, i.e.
``run_p1_plan_view``, and ⛔ never S5-S7.  ``test_as_measured_facts_layer.py``
greps this module for the S7 names and fails if one appears.

## Junctions: the layer stores LINES, ⛔ not corner points

Guide §十.6c, measured on sm25: all 54 orthogonal junctions agree -- a wall line
stops at the NEAR FACE of the wall it runs into, so the corner square is claimed
by neither.  A facts layer that stored per-edge corner points would freeze one
particular junction resolution into the record and turn F-134 from "solved in
the S7 expansion step" into "unsolved".  So a wall is stored as
``(two face lines, thickness, along-wall interval)`` and the along-wall interval
is for the denominator and for locating openings -- ⛔ NOT for deciding corners.

## ⭐⭐ A wall is TWO PAIRED FACE LINES -- ⛔ not a converter ``wall_band``

②-1a took ``walls`` straight off ``P1PlanViewGeometry.wall_bands``.  MEASURED
(②-1a-R, 2026-08-29) that was the WRONG SOURCE: ``WallBand``'s own docstring
says it is "grouped from its **jamb caps**" -- the little strokes that cross a
wall at a door or a window -- ⛔ not from the two faces of a wall.  Signed
drawing, ``plan-F1``:

    from ``wall_bands``   45 "walls", thickness {100:1, 120:5, 240:7, 296:1,
                              300:16, 304:1, 356:1, 360:11, 364:1, 500:1} mm
    from face pairing     55 walls,   thickness {120: 28, 240: 27} mm

⛔ The drawing has no 300 mm wall.  Those 16 were a door/window JAMB paired
with the face of a real 120 mm partition 300 mm away, so the reported
"thickness" was the distance from an opening frame to the next wall.  That is
33 walls that do not exist, about to be written into the standard answer that
BOTH reading and correction are then graded against.

⭐ So ``walls`` is now derived by ``denominator.face_line_targets`` -- THE SAME
D1-D5 pass the scoreable denominator runs, ⛔ never a second implementation of
"what a wall face is" -- and the pairing rule is: same axis, overlapping along
the wall, NEAREST opposite face.  ⛔ There is no thickness threshold anywhere in
it: filtering candidate pairs by declared thickness is precisely the mechanism
that silently deleted sm24's entire 120 mm partition family (batch guide §一).

⛔⛔ THE TRAP THAT MAKES THIS NON-OBVIOUS: ``face_lines`` holds 225 strokes on
signed ``plan-F1`` and only 110 of them are pairable.  Pairing all 225 puts the
very same ghosts back, because the other 115 ARE the jamb caps and stubs.  The
exclusion is D2's, REUSED.

⚠️ AXIS CONVENTION -- written down because BOTH seats mis-read it while
diagnosing this: ``denominator``'s ``axis`` names the axis the CONSTANT
coordinate sits on, this module's ``axis`` names the axis a line RUNS ALONG.
They are OPPOSITE.  :func:`_pair_face_lines_into_walls` flips it exactly once,
deliberately ([[cross-representation-mutation-must-be-equivalent]]: a field
NAMED one thing and HOLDING another is how that whole family of errors runs).

⭐ Nothing is deleted by the change: the 45 bands are still carried, verbatim,
as ``converter_readouts.jamb_cap_bands`` -- under a name that says what they
are grouped from.

## 0.1 mm integers, and why that is a REPRESENTATION change, ⛔ not a snap

User 2026-08-29: coordinates are stored as integers in units of 0.1 mm.  ⛔ This
is not a tolerance and ⛔ not an extra snapping pass -- the converter has already
quantised; this is the *storage type*.  Floats cannot be compared bit-for-bit
after a round trip, and F-98's family of "the two rulers disagree in the 12th
decimal" problems is a property of the representation, not of the geometry.
Every geometric number below is ``int``; ⛔ there is no float in the document
outside ``converter_readouts``, where the converter's own records ride out
VERBATIM (see below).  ``test_as_measured_facts_layer.py`` asserts exactly that.

## ⛔ Nothing is silently re-measured from the drawing

The measured geometry is either copied from ``P1PlanViewGeometry`` or is a unit
conversion of something copied from it.  Boundary conditions are a named
topological derivation over those stored integers, with an independent
compiler-side recomputation.  The 2026-08-29 lesson (the converter had already
computed the readouts and the consumer dropped them on the floor) is why
``dangles`` / ``cuts`` / ``invalid`` / ``diagnostics`` / ``gates`` are carried
through untouched, ⛔ never recomputed.

⭐ And nothing is dropped silently either ([[absence-conflates-causes-in-observables]]).
``wall_lines`` can legitimately contain a stroke that is neither horizontal nor
vertical (measured: 1 in as-received ``plan-F1`` -- F-129).  It cannot be a
"face line at a constant coordinate", so it is itemised in
``converter_readouts.non_orthogonal_lines`` and a model validator enforces the
ledger identity

    wall_lines_total == len(face_lines) + non_orthogonal + degenerate

so a stroke can never leave the record by simply not being appended to a list.
