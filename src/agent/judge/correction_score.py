# Single declared judge-side output convention — RUNTIME ENFORCED (F-22
# BLOCKER-1 fix, 2026-08-11 sol cross-review + user-ratified correction).
#
# This is the ONE place that states which physical frame a 1_correction
# product's coordinates are TRUSTED to be expressed in, for scoring against
# gt without a frame conversion —
#   * exterior envelope (footprint / floor.footprint) == the wall's OUTER
#     FACE.  This is the same face gt's `footprint.W_m`/`D_m` are measured
#     to (gt also separately records `wall_thickness_m`, purely as metadata
#     for that outer-skin dimension — not as a hint that judge-side geometry
#     needs converting).
#   * interior partition walls == the wall CENTRELINE.  This is the same
#     line gt's `zones[].rect_m` edges sit on (see `derive_gt_wall_segments`
#     in reading_score.py — an interior gt wall's declared extent already
#     runs edge-to-edge of the outer footprint, i.e. touches the outer skin
#     at its ends, not an inset centerline point).
#
# Before 2026-08-09 (F-17) a 1_correction product's exterior envelope was
# expressed at the wall CENTRELINE, so this scorer used to convert it
# outward by half `wall_thickness_m` before comparing to gt (see git history
# of `_boundary_centerline_to_outer` / `_expand_boundary_span`, removed
# earlier in F-22). F-17 fixed the deterministic core's envelope transform
# so a schema-v3 (`orthogonal_polygon`) product's own footprint is now
# already expressed at the outer face — i.e. that ONE profile already
# matches this declared convention with no transform needed.
#
# ⛔ NARROWED SCOPE (sol BLOCKER-1, 2026-08-11): the first cut of this fix
# treated EVERY schema version as already-outer-skin unconditionally. Real
# measurement on this repo's own historical runs proved that false: schema
# v1/v2 (`rectangular`, which is the CLI's DEFAULT capability_profile) has
# NEVER been verified to share this frame, and real v1/v2 artifacts on disk
# sit at inconsistent, unregistered offsets (measured examples: exactly
# [0,0] some runs, [-0.1,-0.1] others, [-0.22,-0.23] on a third — no fixed
# relationship to gt's outer skin at all). Directly comparing those against
# gt "because there's only one convention now" reproduced a NEW variant of
# the same double-expansion-era bug (an asymmetric miss on 2 of 4 boundary
# sides, and dropped interior-wall hits, purely from betting on an unproven
# frame) — see `AI_agent/logs/reviews/verdict/2026-08-11_f22_f9s0s1_crossreview_sol.md`
# BLOCKER-1 for the reproduction. The user-ratified correction is: trust
# schema v3 (`orthogonal_polygon`) ONLY; everything else is explicitly
# rejected (not guessed) — see `_is_trusted_output_convention` below, which
# every extraction site calls and which every caller must treat as
# authoritative. This is NOT a second conversion branch (the user's "single
# output convention, no switch" instruction from the original F-22 dispatch
# still holds) — untrusted inputs get NO conversion of any kind, they get
# refused.
#
# ⛔⛔ STILL NARROWER (sol re-review 2026-08-12, BLOCKER-1 remained OPEN after
# the narrowing above): `schema_version == "3"` alone is NOT proof of
# `outer_skin_exterior_centerline_interior` either. A bug fix to the core's
# transform logic (F-17, 2026-08-09) does not bump `schema_version` — by
# design, this project's own convention is "fixing a bug never changes the
# version number" — so the SAME `schema_version == "3"` spans real,
# byte-identical-looking runs both BEFORE and AFTER that fix
# (`run_2026-08-09_f17_e2e_verify`, pre-fix, footprint `[0.12,14.88]`, vs.
# `run_2026-08-11_continuous_e2e`, post-fix, footprint `[0,15]` — same
# `capability_profile`, same declared config). Trusting on schema alone
# scored the pre-fix run five-for-five `pass`, 0.12 m off on every side, with
# zero refusal evidence. The fix is a SEPARATE, unconditional identity the
# deterministic core itself stamps on every v3 completion regardless of
# whether anything changed (`DeterministicCoreStampV1`,
# `src/agent/correction/schema.py`; written by
# `deterministic.apply_deterministic_core`, see that function's v3 branch) —
# `schema_version` states WHAT SHAPE a product claims to be; the stamp states
# WHICH REVISION OF THE CORE actually produced it. Both are now required.
#
# `CORRECTION_OUTPUT_CONVENTION` is the ONE declaration of the identity
# currently trusted; `_is_trusted_output_convention()` is the ONE runtime
# read of it (now joined by `deterministic_module.DETERMINISTIC_CORE_STAMP_VERSION`
# for the post-transform half of that identity — referenced via the module,
# not `from ... import`, so a test that mutates
# `deterministic_module.DETERMINISTIC_CORE_STAMP_VERSION` is read live, the
# same "single declared source, no drift" discipline `CORRECTION_OUTPUT_CONVENTION`
# already uses). Self-test (required by sol, and locked by
# `tests/test_judge_batch_b.py::test_output_convention_declaration_mutation_changes_scoring_behavior`):
# mutate this constant's VALUE and rerun scoring on a real, otherwise-valid
# schema-v3 product — the result MUST change (boundary/wall-extent scoring
# must stop trusting it), proving the declaration is load-bearing and not
# decorative. The same self-test discipline now also applies to the stamp
# version (`tests/test_f22_blocker1_core_stamp.py`).
#
# This constant is the seam for a future second convention (the deferred
# "标注/墙厚/出模" work item): a second named identity would be added, and
# `_is_trusted_output_convention` — the only reader — is the only place that
# would need to grow a branch. Nothing else in this module may assume a
# frame on its own.

    F-22 BLOCKER-1 round 2 (2026-08-13, sol re-review): the pre-2026-08-13
    version of this function WAS `_is_declared_output_convention` above, in
    full — trusting a self-reported stamp alone. sol's reproduction: forge a
    candidate's footprint/floor-ring/cells together, re-derive every
    downstream artifact (Vg, host claims, evidence) FROM the tampered
    footprint so everything is internally self-consistent, keep the stamp
    byte-identical — the real `StageRunner.record` writer accepted and
    persisted it, because nothing compared the writer's own independent core
    REPLAY against the candidate's footprint/floors/cells (only against
    windows' host-resolved half). "这个字段,被评判的一方能不能自己写?能写=>
    最多叫declared,绝不能叫trusted" (2026-08-13 dispatch's guiding question).

    Trust now additionally requires a writer-issued
    `DeterministicCoreProofV1` (deterministic.py) — issued by
    `StageRunner.record`'s B5 write path ONLY after it independently
    replayed the core from the candidate's own re-verified raw producer
    bytes and confirmed the replay's `core_owned_projection_v1` byte-matches
    the candidate's — AND that proof must be RE-VERIFIED here, against the
    CURRENT geometry actually being scored:

    1. `_is_declared_output_convention(geom)` — the self-report must still be
       internally plausible (a broken/absent stamp is refused regardless of
       any proof supplied — a valid writer-issued proof for some OTHER, correct
       geometry can never rescue a candidate whose own self-report is
       broken; this is a floor, not a substitute for the proof check).
    2. `core_proof is not None` — a writer-issued proof was actually supplied.
       The caller (judge-side scoring entry point, which HAS run/manifest
       context this function deliberately does not) is responsible for
       resolving a proof ONLY from an accepted manifest record's
       `artifact_hashes["deterministic_core_proof"]`, hash-verified against
       the on-disk sidecar — see `run_stage.py`'s
       `_resolve_core_proof_for_attempt`. This function itself never reads a
       run/manifest; a bare dict/`CorrectedGeometry` with no `core_proof`
       argument can therefore never be more than `declared`.
    3. `core_proof.core_version == deterministic_module.DETERMINISTIC_CORE_STAMP_VERSION`
       — the proof was issued under the CURRENTLY live core revision, not a
       stale one (mirrors the stamp check, but against the proof's own
       recorded version, so a bump to the live constant untrusts BOTH the
       self-report and any previously issued proof, with no fallback).
    4. `core_proof.core_projection_hash == hash_obj(core_owned_projection_v1(geom))`
       — recomputed HERE, on THIS geometry, not merely read off the proof.
       This is what defeats sol's forged-candidate reproduction: a proof
       genuinely issued for the correct producer replay will never hash-match
       a DIFFERENT, tampered geometry, no matter how internally
       self-consistent that tampered geometry's own derived artifacts are.

    Returns False for everything else — there is no fallback interpretation;
    untrusted means untrusted.
