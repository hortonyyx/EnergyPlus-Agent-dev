"""Judge harness (M3): verdict schema v2, single-stage blind resample, executor.

The judge is dev-期 scaffolding / a data factory — once a small model is trained
and enough error classes are codified into deterministic checks, the top-tier
judge is retired (contracts §0.3). It never injects commentary into a stage
prompt (invariant 6); retries are blind resamples.
