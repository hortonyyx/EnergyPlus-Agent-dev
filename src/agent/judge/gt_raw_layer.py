"""GT **raw layer** reader + mechanical reproduction gate — judge② / human side ONLY.

The user's 2026-08-26 ruling splits gt into three layers: a RAW layer (a faithful
transcription of the drawing, deviations included), an irregularity list, and a
DERIVED answer layer.  This module exposes the first one.

The raw layer is already on disk and has been since the converter was written:
``case_tests/test_baseline/gt/<case>/review/conversion_report.json`` carries, for
every zone edge, ``p1/p2/basis/thickness_m/offset_m/source_handles`` plus the
thickness proof handles.  R-6 ("measured it, used it, threw it away when saving")
is therefore **inaccurate** and is corrected here: it is *saved*, but until now
(a) no scoring path read it and (b) it sits **outside the human signature**.

⛔ Same lock as :mod:`src.agent.judge.gt` (gt iron law, CLAUDE.md §1.5#4): only
the gate② judge and humans may import this.  gate① checks and the stage
executors must stay blind.  ``tests/test_gt_discipline.py`` enforces it.

## Why a reproduction gate at all (G1-b)

``tarch_review_bundle._RUNTIME_BUNDLE_FILES`` lists ``conversion_report.json``
among the *non-indexed* runtime files, so ``review_index.json`` never hashes it
and the human ``review_ack.json`` does not cover it.  Its trustworthiness can
therefore not come from the signature.  It can only come from *reproducing* it
mechanically out of inputs that ARE signed:

    review_ack.json  --signs-->  source.dxf sha256   (byte hash)
                     --signs-->  request_sha256      (RECOMPUTED from content,
                                                      never the declared field)

Re-running the converter on those two and comparing the result field-by-field is
what :func:`verify_raw_layer_reproduction` does.

Both of those inputs are resolved from **one case-owned persistent directory**,
``case_tests/test_baseline/gt_sources/<case>/`` -- see
:func:`case_signed_inputs_root`.  ⛔ That is a statement about *availability*,
not about trust: neither resolver ever accepts a file because of where it sits.

⛔ Content fields, never bytes.  The converter's normalized-DXF bytes (and hence
``normalized_dxf_sha256``) depend on Python hash randomisation; comparing bytes
would be a guaranteed false red.  Measured on 2026-08-27: the content fields are
identical across PYTHONHASHSEED 1 / 7 / 12345.

## The two reds are kept apart (G1-b, ⭐)

``implementation_drift``  the converter/config/extractor fingerprints recorded in
                          the signed artefacts no longer match this tree.  The
                          on-disk report may still be exactly what the reviewer
                          approved; it is *this tree* that moved.
``content_mismatch``      the fingerprints all match, so the same implementation
                          was re-run — and it did not produce what is on disk.
                          That points at the artefact.

The fingerprint check runs FIRST and returns early, so a drifted tree can never
be reported as a suspect artefact.

### Which fingerprints are fatal, and why exactly those

The **fatal** set contains the three fingerprints the report itself binds —
``converter_sha256`` (= the 13-file conversion CLOSURE, AST-normalized —
widened 2026-08-29, dispatch ②-1b R4/F-D; see ``tarch_normalize.
CONVERTER_CLOSURE_FILES``), ``judge_config_sha256`` and ``vg_config_sha256`` —
plus the signed ``gt.json`` generator's ``vg_implementation_sha256``.  The
latter is an exact group hash over the four correction modules in the
measured conversion import closure, with no closure-external file, so it is a
precise converter-drift signal.

⚠️ ``converter_sha256`` specifically is compared through
:func:`_expected_converter_sha256`, which accepts EITHER the current widened
value OR a member of ``tarch_normalize.KNOWN_PRE_F_D_CONVERTER_SHA256`` for a
record that still carries one of those pinned legacy values — a named,
bounded exemption for the one artefact (sm25-L_anchor) that was clean before
the widening.  sm24_anchor's legacy value is deliberately NOT in that set —
F-132 already found it drifted under the OLD definition too, and this gate
must keep reporting that, not launder it into "reproduced" as a side effect
of the widening.

The signed generator also carries ``extractor_sha256`` and
``validator_sha256``.  Those remain **advisory** because their groups include
closure-external files.  In particular, ``extractor_sha256`` includes
``scripts/tool_scripts/gt_from_dxf.py``, a CLI entry point that the conversion
closure was measured (2026-08-27) not to load.  Treating that group as fatal
would turn a CLI-only edit into converter drift.

⚠️ **Declared blind spot.**  ``gt_extraction.py``, ``gt_manifest.py``,
``gt_schema.py`` and ``tarch_converter_schema.py`` are in the conversion import
closure but have no exactly-scoped signed fingerprint.  Drift confined to them
is therefore reported as ``content_mismatch``, not ``implementation_drift`` —
the difference is still caught loudly, but its attribution is wrong.

## Nothing degrades silently (G1-c)

:class:`RawLayerTrust` always says what the trust root actually is.  A raw layer
whose reproduction was never attempted reports ``reproduction=None`` and
``status="not_attempted"`` — it never reads as "verified".  The same holds when
the signed inputs cannot be found (``inputs_unavailable``).
