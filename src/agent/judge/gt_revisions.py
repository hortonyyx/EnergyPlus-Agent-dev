"""``revisions`` -- the second cut of the facts layer -- and ``as_signed``, its
mechanical derivation from :mod:`src.agent.judge.as_measured`.

    as_measured  +  revisions  =>  as_signed        (ledger §一 / §三 / §六)
                    ^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^  THIS FILE.

⭐ WHAT THIS FILE IS: the shape of ONE human-signed correction (``RevisionV1``),
a ledger of them (``RevisionsLedgerV1``), and a PURE function
(:func:`derive_as_signed`) that folds a ledger onto an ``AsMeasuredV1`` to
produce ``AsSignedV1`` -- plus the reproducibility gate that keeps the two in
sync (:func:`verify_as_signed_reproduction`).

⛔ WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT: a place that writes ``revisions.json`` on anyone's
behalf.  ledger §九#3 / guide precedent (F-117): "只有签字流程能写
revisions" -- this module never touches a filesystem path, and the only way an
UNSIGNED record could reach :func:`derive_as_signed` and do anything is
already closed at the type level (see ``RevisionV1``'s own validator): a
record with ``verdict == "unsigned"`` cannot carry an ``action`` at all, so
there is no code path in :func:`derive_as_signed` that needs to notice it is
unsigned -- it structurally has nothing to apply.

## Two kinds of "action" on one record, ⛔ never conflated

``candidate_action`` -- what a DETECTOR proposes, before anyone has signed
anything.  Advisory only; :func:`derive_as_signed` never reads it.

``action`` -- what a SIGNED ``verdict == "drawing_error"`` record actually
does.  The model validator below makes the pairing structural: ``action`` may
be non-``None`` if and only if the record is signed AND its verdict is
``drawing_error``.  Naming the two differently means "a machine's guess" and
"an authorised instruction" can never be the same field silently swapped for
each other ([[observation-named-as-fact-travels-as-fact]]).

## What ``translate`` is, and is not (dispatch ①: "先只实现 translate")

A ``translate`` action names ONE integer field of ONE ``AsMeasuredFaceLineV1``
(picked out by ``(view_id, handle)``) and a signed delta in the document's own
0.1 mm units.  It is a deterministic operation ON ``as_measured`` in the
literal sense: given the same as_measured document and the same action, the
result is one line of arithmetic, re-validated by the SAME model
(``AsMeasuredFaceLineV1``) that already enforces ``along_min < along_max`` --
so a translate that produces an ill-formed line fails LOUDLY, at
:func:`derive_as_signed` time, rather than silently.

⛔ MEASURED (this unit, sm25's 5-line R1 batch), and worth stating because it
contradicts the ledger's own illustrative example: a "move this wall over"
translate is not what most real corrections look like.  Of the 5 changed
DXF handles between ``sm25-L_t3_as_received.dxf`` and ``sm25-L_t3.dxf``
(13AD 13AC 13AF 160A 13AE), only 2 (13AC, 160A) are a translate of an
existing face line's own ``along_min``/``along_max`` (a ~0.2 mm endpoint
trim).  The other 3 (13AD, 13AE, 13AF) are NON-ORTHOGONAL strokes in the
as-received drawing (up to ~5.8 mm off axis) that become perfectly
axis-aligned face lines in the signed one -- straightening a diagonal into an
axis-aligned line is not expressible as "add a delta to one stored field",
it is a different, well-defined operation this dispatch does not implement
(①'s "遇到再加").  ``scripts/tool_scripts`` has no detector for it yet;
those 3 candidates are produced with ``candidate_action=None`` and a
``finding.detail`` that says why, rather than a wrong or approximate
translate.

## Propagation scope (⛔ a named limitation, not an oversight)

:func:`derive_as_signed` updates ONLY the targeted face line's named field.
It does NOT re-run wall pairing, does not touch ``walls``/``openings``, and
does not recompute ``footprint``.  A translate large enough to change which
face lines pair into a wall, or to move an opening's carrier, is out of this
unit's scope -- ②-1c owns ``AnswerCompiler`` and the dependency closures that
would need to notice such a change.  This is stated here rather than silently
producing a ``walls``/``openings`` block that quietly disagrees with the
(now-edited) ``face_lines``.
