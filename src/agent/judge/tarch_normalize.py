"""Tianzheng (天正) real-building DXF -> GT v3: P1 algorithm body (S0-S4).

Built strictly on top of the P0-frozen contracts in
:mod:`tarch_converter_schema`.  This module implements the **geometry stages
only**:

  S0  input preflight   proxy=0 / units explicit / view frame + unique title /
                        non-axis-parallel rejected
  S1  coordinate quantize   ``q = tau_node/10`` (a derived value); G2 conservation
                        (quantize may denoise but never merge two coords > tau_node
                        apart); zero-length (degenerate) lines bookkept as INFO;
                        a stroke whose two legs both exceed ``tau_axis`` is
                        SNAPPED onto its dominant axis (short leg -> zero) when
                        the short leg is within ``AXIS_SNAP_MAX_DEVIATION_M``
                        (10 mm) AND the stroke's angle off-axis is within

                        landed by F-147; ⛔ the angle gate did not exist
                        before F-147) -- and itemised as
                        ``tarch_wall_axis_snapped`` (INFO) carrying BOTH
                        readings; failing EITHER gate it is still refused,
                        as ``tarch_wall_nonorthogonal`` (BLOCK), whose
                        context now NAMES the gate(s) that refused it
  S2  wall collect + jamb-cap identification  the short cross-section lines are
                        thickness evidence kind #2 (``wall_cap_or_opening_jamb``);
                        the legal thickness *range* is a sanity bound only, never
                        the *source* of a thickness (plan §2.1)
  S3  opening dual-evidence resolution   block bbox gives the along-wall span,
                        the wall's own jamb caps give the normal interval; the
                        bbox's normal extent must overlap the wall band (this is
                        what excludes a door's swing arc — D2).  Exactly one
                        solution fills; 0/many fail (plan §4 S3).
  S4  topology closure   ``polygonize_full`` over (all walls + all opening fills);
                        ``dangles/cuts/invalid`` all empty AND ``sum(face areas) ==
                        footprint area`` (plan §4 S4 / G5).

It does **not** do S5-S9 (cavities / intent binding / per-edge expand / gates
G6-G9 / persist) — that is P2.  No DXF is augmented or promoted in P1 (§0.1
方案A: convert+build always run in staging); the normalization lives in the IR.

Hard disciplines enforced here (dispatch §2 / plan §2):

  1. fail-closed — every ambiguous branch raises a BLOCK diagnostic and stops;
     there is no warn-then-continue path (the report status contract makes a
     PASS-with-BLOCK-diagnostic impossible).
  2. no baked thickness assumption — thickness comes from source geometry: a
     measured jamb cap or a source-bound pair of parallel WALL LINE faces; the
     [t_min, t_max] range is a sanity filter, not a source.  No
     ``DEFAULT_WALL_THICKNESS`` / ``MAX_WALL_PAIR_DISTANCE`` constant.
  3. non-exact-orthogonal — axis-ness is decided by ``|dx|,|dy| <= tau_axis``,
     never by float ``==`` (D: walls deviate up to 1.31e-10 mm); a stroke that
     fails this may still be admitted by the SNAP path above rather than
     dropped, but the decision is still a named threshold, never a re-run of
     float ``==``.
  4. no fabricated tolerance — every threshold is read from ``judge_gt.yaml`` via
     :func:`resolve_converter_tooling`; the quantization step is derived
     (``tau_node/10``), not a config key.  ⛔ ONE declared exception:
     ``AXIS_SNAP_MAX_DEVIATION_M`` and ``AXIS_SNAP_MAX_ANGLE_DEG`` are
     plain module constants, not ``judge_gt.yaml`` keys — deliberately.
     Their VALUES are signed (user, 2026-08-30, F-143/F-147), but signing a
     value is not the same act as admitting a KEY into that schema: its
     serialized form is baked into every already-signed gt.json's content
     hash, so a new key there retroactively invalidates signed answers (see
     the constants' own docstrings for the empirical proof).
  5. gt isolation — this module is judge-side.  Tianzheng layer names, block-name
     prefixes and the view-frame convention are read ONLY from the request's
     :class:`TarchDialectRulesV1` / selectors, never from a module constant.

#: ⭐⭐⭐ SIGNED BY THE USER 2026-08-30 (F-143 → landed by F-147).
#: ⛔ No longer a placeholder: the user was shown the distribution and the
#: risk (below) and chose these two values verbatim -- "签，角度调到 1 度吧".
#:
#: What it decides: once a collected wall-line stroke's two legs (|dx|, |dy|)
#: BOTH exceed ``tau_axis`` (``dxf_axis_alignment_tolerance_m``, 1 mm -- i.e. it
#: is not already axis-aligned within measurement noise), this value is the
#: FIRST of TWO gates (see ``AXIS_SNAP_MAX_ANGLE_DEG`` for the second, and
#: ``_collect_walls`` for the AND) between "drawn crooked" (admit: snap the
#: SHORT leg to zero, see ``_snap_short_leg_to_axis``) and "a real diagonal
#: line" (still refused, unchanged ``tarch_wall_nonorthogonal`` BLOCK + drop).
#:
#: ⭐ Why it exists as a SEPARATE constant and not a new key on
#: ``judge_gt.yaml`` / ``GtExtractionTolerancesV1``: EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED
#: (②-1b-S execution report) that adding even an OPTIONAL field with a
#: default to that schema flips ``gt_hash_content_mismatch`` on the real
#: SIGNED ``sm25-L_anchor/gt.json`` -- that schema's serialized form is baked
#: into every already-signed gt.json's ``content_sha256``.  Signing the VALUE
#: (what the user did) is not the same act as admitting the KEY into that
#: trust root (which would invalidate already-signed hashes), so it stays
#: here, exactly as ``MERGE_M`` in ``as_drawn/denominator.py`` is a plain
#: declared module constant rather than a ``judge_gt.yaml`` key.
#:
#: ⭐ Evidence the user was shown before signing: the only two instances in
#: the whole in-scope corpus (sm24_anchor signed, sm25-L_anchor signed,
#: sm25-L_anchor as-received -- ``sm21_anchor`` ships no ``request.json`` and
#: is not converted through this path at all, see
#: ``tests/test_affine_magnitude_gate.py::UNSIGNED_ANCHORS``) are sm25
#: as-received ``plan-F1`` handles 13AD (minor leg 5.8084 mm, 0.091°) and
#: 13AE (5.8087 mm, 0.091°) -- one physical drafting slip, two faces.
#: 10 mm admits both with margin and is a round 0.1 mm-grid number.
AXIS_SNAP_MAX_DEVIATION_M = 0.010

#: ⭐⭐⭐ SIGNED BY THE USER 2026-08-30 (F-143 → landed by F-147) -- the SECOND
#: admission gate, ANDed with ``AXIS_SNAP_MAX_DEVIATION_M`` in ``_collect_walls``.
#:
#: ⭐⭐ Why an ANGLE gate had to exist at all, and why tightening the
#: millimetre one could not substitute for it: **the same millimetre number
#: means a ~120x different angle depending on the stroke's length**.  6 mm on
#: the 3640 mm stroke 13AD is 0.094° (obvious hand-tremor); 6 mm on a 30 mm
#: stroke is 11.310° (an unmistakable diagonal).  An absolute-millimetre
#: threshold is therefore the WRONG SHAPE for this decision: it is
#: simultaneously too permissive on long strokes (a gentle slant sails
#: through) and too twitchy on short ones.  The angle gate is the dimension
#: the millimetre gate structurally cannot see.  ⛔ That is why this is a new
#: gate rather than a smaller value for the old one.
#:
#: ⛔⛔ SIGNED RESIDUAL RISK, recorded because it is real and was accepted
#: with full knowledge, ⛔ NOT because it is believed to be correct:
#: **1.0° admits the cross-reviewer's 0.39° gently-slanted wall**.  That
#: negative sample was built end-to-end on an as-received copy: two faces,
#: 800 mm long, each 5.5 mm out, 120 mm apart -- both faces snap to their
#: midlines, the pair stays exactly 120 mm apart, and the pairing step
#: therefore MANUFACTURES a wall that does not exist on the drawing
#: (walls 55 -> 56).  This is the same defect family as the project's 33
#: fabricated walls.  0.25° would refuse it.  The admissible interval was
#: only ``(0.091°, 0.394°)`` -- one real tremor on one side, one synthetic
#: slant on the other -- and 0.25°/0.3° were recommended.  The user restated
#: the consequence and still chose 1.0°.
#: ⭐ The compensating control is the LAST gate: every admission emits
#: ``tarch_wall_axis_snapped`` and the facts transport copies BOTH
#: ``minor_leg_mm`` and ``angle_deg`` onto its corresponding itemised
#: ``axis_snapped_lines`` row.  The signer can therefore review the two signed
#: gate readings on the row itself instead of joining it to diagnostics by
#: handle (F-148).
#: See ``tests/test_tarch_converter_p1_geometry.py``'s
#: ``..._KNOWN_SIGNED_RISK`` test for the executable form of this paragraph.

#: ⭐⭐ F-D (dispatch ②-1b R4): the files that make up "the conversion
#: IMPLEMENTATION" for fingerprinting purposes.  ⛔ NOT hand-picked: this is
#: what a real closure walk from THIS file finds, by two mechanisms that are
#: each individually checked (not merely believed):
#:
#: 1. MODULE-LEVEL imports, transitively, from every ``from .X import ...`` /
#:    ``from src.agent....X import ...`` statement written at column 0 of a
#:    file already in the set.  ``tests/test_tarch_converter_reproducibility.py
#:    ::test_f_d_closure_membership_matches_a_static_import_walk`` re-derives
#:    this half mechanically and fails loudly if it and this tuple disagree --
#:    that is the "membership has an out" this fingerprint is required to have.
#:
#: 2. ONE lazy (function-body) import that a top-level-only scan cannot see:
#:    ``_run_g9_v3_preflight`` -- itself called from ``run_p2_conversion``, on
#:    the real P2 conversion path -- does ``from .gt_extraction import
#:    extract_gt_v3`` to run "the real v3 extractor" as a preflight GATE, so
#:    ``gt_extraction.py``'s bytes really can change what a conversion reports.
#:    (``gt_extraction.py``'s own top-level imports are already members of
#:    this set, so it adds no further files.)
#:
#: Two OTHER lazy imports elsewhere in this same closure were CHECKED and
#: EXCLUDED, not merely unnoticed -- each is grep-verified dead from every
#: entry point this fingerprint covers:
#:   * ``gt_schema.py``'s ``from .gt import DEFAULT_GT_DIR`` lives in
#:     ``_protected_candidate_path``, whose only caller (``write_gt_v3_candidate``)
#:     is called ONLY by the CLI ``scripts/tool_scripts/gt_from_dxf.py`` --
#:     never by anything on the conversion path.  (This mirrors the ALREADY
#:     declared blind spot for ``extractor_sha256`` in gt_raw_layer.py, which
#:     excludes that same CLI script for the same measured reason.)
#:   * ``schema.py``'s ``from src.agent.correction.window_host import
#:     WindowHostResolutionAuditV1`` runs only inside ``CorrectedGeometryV3``'s
#:     own validator, gated on a ``kind == "window_host_resolution"`` row.
#:     Nothing on the conversion path ever constructs a ``CorrectedGeometryV3``
#:     (the only ``CorrectedGeometryV3.model_validate`` call sites in the whole
#:     judge package are ``correction_score.py`` / ``score_service.py`` /
#:     ``segment_score.py``, none of which this closure imports).
