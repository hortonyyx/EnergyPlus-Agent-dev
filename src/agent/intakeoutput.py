"""5_intakeoutput — deterministic assembly of the final IntakeOutput.

Combines the deterministic geometry specs (from the kernel serializer) with the
non-geometry specs the 4_MEP LLM stage authors, then runs a deterministic
contract check before the result leaves the project boundary. The check is an
early, deterministic fail for the one cross-stage hazard the split introduces:
the serializer emits construction names (e.g. `Cons_InterFloor`) that 4_MEP must
define — if 4_MEP omits one, the surfaces referencing it would drop and EnergyPlus
would fatal. We catch that here, by name, not at EP.
