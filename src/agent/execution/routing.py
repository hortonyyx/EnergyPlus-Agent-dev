"""Failure classification → routing decision (M2a/M3 seam, contracts §0.3).

A stage failure is classified by *the stage's capability* before any routing
decision — never "always bounce upstream" (Codex design H1). Given a blocking
CheckReport, :func:`route_stage_failure` returns the action the orchestrator must
take:

  capability      blocking failure → action
  ─────────────   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  manual          ``human_redraw_required``  (0_reading today; auto resample only
                  opens once a VLM runner is wired)
  stochastic      ``blind_resample``         (1_correction / 4_mep: same input,
                  different sampling; judge text never injected into the prompt)
  deterministic   ``fail_closed``            (core / 2 / 3 / 5: a code defect to
                  raise; NEVER bounce upstream or swap the sample to mask it)

A clean report routes to ``proceed``. The orchestrator consults the budget
(invalidation.RunBudget) before acting on ``blind_resample``.
