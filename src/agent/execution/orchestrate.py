"""Agent-orchestration helpers for the dev baseline workflow (2026-06-16).

In the dev period the main conversational Agent is the orchestrator + judge②
(see AI_agent/guides/new_case_guide.md). Each stage is run by an isolated
executor (a separate API call or a cold-started sub-agent) so judge / cross-stage
info never pollutes a stage's input. This module gives the orchestrator two thin
primitives over the M0 audit layer:

  - ``file_stage_attempt`` — file ONE draw as an append-only attempt
    (``<stage>/attempts/NNN/{output,checks,judge}``) and move the manifest's
    accepted pointer if it passed. This is where the Agent's judge verdict is
    persisted (judge.json), realizing "attempts 全上".
  - ``summarize_gates`` — roll a set of stage CheckReports into the per-stage
    pass/flag/block counts + the flag detail list that feed baseline.json and
    report/FACTS.md.

It deliberately does NOT inject anything into a stage prompt — repair/resample
discipline lives in judge/retry.py (blind resample; judge_retry_context never
injected).
