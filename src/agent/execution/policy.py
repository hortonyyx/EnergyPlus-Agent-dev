"""Run policy — the calling-strategy knobs that gate behaviour without changing
what the validators report (M0 CLI policy).

Kept separate from the validators (fact ≠ policy). A caller (CLI / batch / CI)
constructs a :class:`RunPolicy` and the orchestrator consults it to decide:
  - whether the user geometry-confirmation gate blocks (``confirmation_policy``),
  - whether the dev-期 LLM/VLM judge layer runs at all (``judge_enabled``),
  - the draw/judge budget (mapped onto invalidation.RunBudget),
  - the validation scope (``--intake-from`` ⇒ ``downstream_only``: skip 0–4
    validation, only validate the supplied IntakeOutput downstream).
