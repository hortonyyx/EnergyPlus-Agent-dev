"""F-51 (second cut): pre-resize staged reader images to the vision API's own
resize target, so the frame the reading VLM sees, the frame on disk in
staging, and the frame ``cv_probe`` reads are the SAME frame by construction.

Background (see ``AI_agent/logs/experiments/2026-08-16_707_repro/``): the
Claude vision API silently downsamples an oversized image before the model
ever sees it (Anthropic docs, "How Claude resizes and pads images"). The
reading agent's self-reported pixel coordinates therefore live in the
POST-resize frame, while ``cv_probe`` (and the "F-51 first cut" sidecar
``source_image.width_px/height_px`` echo in ``cv_toolbox/sidecar.py``) reads
the ORIGINAL file on disk. A calibration built from such mismatched
coordinates can be self-consistent yet globally wrong (uniform scale error),
and crops land in the wrong region as honest false negatives.

Anthropic's own recommendation (not a workaround this project invented):
resize the image yourself before it is ever shown, so the reader's pixel
coordinates need no frame conversion at all. This module implements that
resize using the documented rule so the staged copy in ``case_data/`` is
already at the size the API would have produced:

- Visual tokens: ``ceil(w/28) * ceil(h/28)``.
- A tier caps both the longest edge (rounded up to a 28px patch) AND the
  token count; the target size is the largest that satisfies both, holding
  aspect ratio, found by binary search along the long edge (short edge via
  Python's banker's-rounding ``round()`` — this matches the documented
  algorithm, verified against the docs' own worked example: an image of
  1075x1520 must resize to exactly 924x1307 under the standard tier).
- The API pads the resized frame to a multiple of 28px afterward, but the
  pad is bottom/right only and never shifts the origin, so callers should
  convert using the RESIZED size below, never the padded size (per the same
  Anthropic doc page) — this module returns the resized (pre-pad) size,
  which is what a caller should compare pixel coordinates against.

Only images that exceed a tier's limits are touched; an image already within
the tier round-trips byte-for-byte (no PIL re-encode), so this is a no-op for
this project's elevation drawings (verified: all four elevations for the
current anchor cases already fit the standard tier; only the two plan views
do not).
