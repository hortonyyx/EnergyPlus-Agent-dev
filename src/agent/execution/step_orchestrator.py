"""Stepwise judge-in-the-loop orchestrator (backlog #1, 2026-06-19).

Turns the dev-baseline run from "run the whole chain, then judge after the fact"
into a per-stage BLOCKING loop the main Agent drives turn by turn (the ideal in
AI_agent/guides/new_case_guide.md §2):

    for each stage 0..5:
        draw (executor) ──► gate① (deterministic check)
                              │ block + stochastic/manual → blind resample ≤ budget
                              │ block + deterministic      → fail-closed (code defect)
                              ▼
                          gate① pass
                              │ judge stage (J0/J1 enabled) → STOP: AWAITING_JUDGE
                              │ geometry checkpoint (after 3) → STOP: AWAITING_GEOMETRY_APPROVAL
                              │ else (2/3/5, 4_mep J4-disabled) → advance
        Agent submits StageVerdict:
            non-blocking                      → JUDGE_PASS (advance)
            blocking + routable + stochastic  → JUDGE_BLOCK (blind resample, same budget)
            blocking + manual (0_reading)     → AWAITING_REREAD if runner-enabled, else human
            blocking + unattributed/low-conf  → JUDGE_BLOCK_HUMAN (交人, stop)

Disciplines this module mechanically keeps:
  - A judge-driven resample is a BLIND resample — judge commentary is NEVER fed
    into a draw prompt (invariant 6, mirrors judge/retry.py). The draw loop here
    always injects ``None``.
  - Budget is DISK-DERIVED: the per-stage cap counts ``attempts/NNN`` on disk, so
    gate①-block resamples and judge-block resamples draw from the *same* well of
    ``per_stage_draws`` across separate CLI invocations. NOTE this counts *semantic*
    draws — one outer draw = one filed attempt facing gate①. A stochastic executor
    (run_correction/run_mep) may itself retry ≤3× internally for transport /
    malformed-JSON robustness (``_call_json_llm``); that lower layer is NOT the
    gate①/judge resample and never masks a gate①-wrong draw (well-formed-but-wrong
    always reaches the outer loop and is counted), so "反复不过就停" stays intact —
    the only cost is one semantic draw can be >1 LLM call. (Archiving inner rejects
    is a deferred audit refinement — review 2026-06-19 High-2.)
  - The geometry checkpoint is a *calling policy* (ConfirmationPolicy), wired here
    as a blocking human gate: 4_mep refuses to run until the geometry digest is
    approved (approval.py binds the digest so an approved checkpoint is reused,
    not silently regenerated).

This module owns only the decision logic + the small ``orchestration_state.json``
ledger; the real stage executors / renderers / the judge (the Agent) are injected,
so the core is unit-testable with fakes (no LLM / EP / geometry).
