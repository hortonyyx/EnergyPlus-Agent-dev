"""S-2 + S-3 run-level provisioning wrapper (the "declare → freeze → prove"
transaction).

``provision_view_manifest`` freezes CASE identity (the trusted view manifest);
this module freezes RUN identity (the effective run policy) and adds the two
strict-profile fail-closed gates that the lossy defaults used to bypass:

  - **L-13** (S-2): a NEW run must declare its structured ``run_profile`` — it
    may not silently default to exploratory. Delegates to
    :func:`provision_run_policy` (``run_profile=None`` raises
    ``run_profile_not_declared``).
  - **L-20** (S-3): a strict run (``golden``/``regression``) whose case declared
    a STRUCTURED ``dimensioned_views`` may not leave a required view ``unknown``
    — the exam question was never answered, which is a fail-closed provisioning
    fault, never a silent ``False`` manifest.

Legacy cases (absent / stem-string ``dimensioned_views``) and legacy runs (no
``run_config.yaml`` run_profile) are read-only replays and never fail here
(G-6): the strict fail-closed gates only trigger on a NEW provisioning that
declares a strict tier.
