#   path role     -> UNCONDITIONAL _lexical_check + _path_arg
#   everything else, INCLUDING UNKNOWN KEYS -> path role (fail-closed default)
#
# Rationale (r1 shipped the third branch and it was a real deny->allow
# regression): r1 kept `_looks_like_path(value)` as a pre-gate for every
# non-content string, so a bare, slash-less, extension-less value slipped
# through even when its key was explicitly `file_path` —
# `Read {"file_path": "case_tests"}` went DENY (pre-batch) -> ALLOW, and a bare
# top-level escaping symlink (`{"file_path": "escape"}`, escape -> /etc/passwd)
# was never handed to _path_arg at all. Security must not depend on what a
# string looks like. Making the default path-role means any parameter added by a
# future tool is safe by default; exempting one requires adding it to
# CONTENT_ROLE_KEYS by name, so this hole cannot come back in a fourth shape.
#
# Content role = parameters that carry FREE TEXT rather than a path. Where a
# write lands is governed by _sole_write_target (the real file_path), so scanning
# free text adds zero security value while the false-positive cost is repeatedly
# demonstrated live (text containing any '/' — a date like 2026/07/31 is enough —
# plus a domain term such as 'grade line'). See evaluate().
#
# R3-1: r2 shipped only the four Write/Edit/NotebookEdit text BODIES here, so the
# fail-closed default relocated the very friction this batch exists to remove:
# `TodoWrite {"activeForm": "Marking the grade line"}` and
# `Grep {"pattern": "z ~ 0.0"}` were both refused, with zero safety value. The
# enumeration below is derived, not guessed:
#
#   (a) isolation._write_settings permits exactly Read / Write / Edit / Bash
#       (plus the always-available no-permission tools Glob / Grep / TodoWrite;
#       WebFetch / WebSearch / Agent / Task / mcp__* are denied outright).
#   (b) The 07-30 run's access_log.jsonl (attempt 003, 82 entries) shows the
#       reader really used Read (37) / Bash (26) / Write (18) / Edit (1); the log
#       records parameter names only on deny entries, where `command` and
#       `content` appear. Both of that run's non-Bash refusal reasons
#       ("forbidden token: grade", "home token is forbidden") were free-text
#       parameters, never paths.
#
# Union of (a) and (b), keeping only parameters that are free text under EVERY
# tool that uses the name — so exempting the name can never unscan a path:
#   activeForm  TodoWrite       description  Bash / Agent
#   prompt      Agent/WebFetch  query        WebSearch
# Bash `command` is deliberately absent: it stays under the full strict check.

# every one of them ran with this guard in place and no control arm. The 08-18
# independent investigation found the guard layer is the ONLY large item
# satisfying "absent in all three 9/9 successes, present today" — 07-02 and
# 07-07 had no guard at all, and 07-08 ran inside the staging workspace but via
# codex, which never went through this hook. That makes guard the leading
# suspect and, so far, an untested one.
#
# ⛔ The relaxed profile drops FRICTION ONLY. The answer boundary is byte-for-
# byte identical in both profiles, because a control arm whose "it never touched
# the answers" cannot be trusted answers nothing:
#
#   UNCHANGED (the boundary)   every token in DENY_TOKENS that names the answer

#                              sees) · EXEC_DENY_INDIRECTION (children the guard
#                              never sees) · `$` / backtick · write-target

# F-60 (2026-08-17, found while reviewing an sm21 pilot): these two rules used to
# be the bare substring tests `".." in text` / `"~" in text`, applied to whole
# FILE BODIES by the exec scan. Source files carry prose — comments and string
# literals — and prose legitimately contains both characters, so the tests fired
# on English punctuation:
#
#     print("Scanning for vertical walls...")   -> "parent traversal token"
#     # Find bounds of walls (gray = ~180)      -> "home token"
#     cyan = ~mask                              -> "home token"  (numpy NOT)
#
# The reader's two real pixel-measurement attempts were refused for exactly these
# two reasons, and the resulting artifact ("wrote round numbers instead of
# measuring") is indistinguishable from a reader that never tried. Same family as
# F-49. The comment at CONTENT_ROLE_KEYS already anticipated this class for tool
# PARAMETERS (`wall_..[0-9]`, `z ~ 0.0`); the file-body channel never used it.
#
# ⛔ The rules are NARROWED, not removed — `..` and `~` remain real escape
# vectors. What changed is that they must now appear in a PATH SHAPE:
#
#   traversal: adjacent to a separator (`../`, `..\`, `/..`, `\..`), or standing
#              alone as its own token (`'..'`, `cd ..`). An ellipsis is exempt
#              because `...` is dots-adjacent — and `..../` still contains `../`,
#              so padding does not buy an escape.
#   home:      followed by an optional user name and then a separator (`~/`,
#              `~root/`). `~mask`, `~180`, `~=`, `z ~ 0.0` are not path shapes
#              and no longer match.
#
# ⚠️ Narrowing `~` is only safe because a bare `~` cannot reach the home
# directory through any surviving route, and each of those routes is closed
# INDEPENDENTLY of this regex — deleting any one of them re-opens what the
# narrowing leaves to it:
#   * `cd` and `env` are refused by name in `_check_bash` before any argument is
#     looked at, so `cd ~` never depended on this rule;
#   * every non-flag argument of a READ_ONLY_COMMAND goes through `_path_arg`,
#     which rejects any value starting with `~` outright ("home-relative paths
#     are forbidden"), so `cat ~` is refused there;
#   * `expanduser` and `.home()` — the only constructs that actually EXPAND a
#     tilde — are both in EXEC_DENY_IMPLICIT_PATHS and are untouched.
# That is why the "bare `~` standing alone" branch is deliberately absent: it
# was redundant against the three above and it was the last shape still firing
# on prose (`z ~ 0.0`, the very example CONTENT_ROLE_KEYS cites as free text).

    Scanning only the file named on the command line would be a one-line hole:
    ``out/main.py`` stays clean and does ``import helper``, while ``out/helper.py``
    holds the path.

    ⭐ 2026-08-16, cross-family review (sol) — the first version of this function
    scanned ``*.py`` ONLY, and that was a real, end-to-end reproduced hole with
    two ordinary (non-obfuscated) shapes:

        # 1. run code the scan never saw
        exec(Path('out/payload.txt').read_text())
        # 2. no exec at all — just carry the PATH in a non-.py file
        print(open(open('out/target.txt').read().strip()).read())

    Both are answered here, by the same correction: the audit object is not "the
    Python files" but **every file the reader can write**, because any of them can
    carry either code or a path. Shape #1 is additionally named in
    EXEC_DENY_DYNAMIC so the failure mode ("code the guard never saw") is refused
    by name and not only by where the bytes happen to live.

    Binary files are skipped (crop PNGs and overlays land under ``out/`` and are
    megabytes each). That skip is the honest residual: a path deliberately hidden
    in a binary is not reachable by this scan. It is left open on purpose, per the
    2026-08-13 threat model — this guard answers a reader taking an easy path, not
    one deliberately evading a scanner it knows about — and it is stated rather
