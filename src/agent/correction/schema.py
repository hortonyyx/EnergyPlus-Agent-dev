"""Materialized intermediate geometry for the staged correction pipeline.

correction stage (LLM correction) emits `CorrectedGeometry`; the deterministic core snaps
it; the modeling/MEP stages (LLM modeling) consumes it to produce `IntakeOutput`. Holding this
artifact explicit decouples the stages (swap a model per stage) and makes the
correction checkpoint verifiable and diffable for evaluation.

Geometry is rectangular cells in schema v1 (one cell = one room/zone footprint,
world meters). Schema v2 may use orthogonal polygon cells; `x`/`y` remain
required and are the polygon bbox projection.

    This is the SINGLE source both consumers must agree with — previously
    they each hardcoded their own name list and drifted: the prompt-schema
    stripper (``vocab.producer_facing_json_schema``) already read the marker
    correctly, but ``parse.parse_correction_draw``'s b2-phase draw-contract
    gate independently hardcoded ``facade_segments`` + ``north_axis`` by
    name — so when ``north_axis`` was later found to need the SAME
    protection as ``facade_segments`` (a real run filled it and was
    rejected), only one of the two lists needed updating, and it would have
    been easy to update the wrong one, or only the gate, and quietly
    re-widen the gap. Deriving both from this single function makes that
    class of drift structurally impossible: mark a field once, both
    consumers see it.

    Only inspects ``model_cls.model_fields`` directly (top-level fields of
    the model actually passed in — e.g. ``CorrectedGeometryV3``), NOT nested
    models reached through them (e.g. ``WindowV3.facade_segment_id``, a
    per-window field). Nested list-of-submodel fields (``windows``) are
    covered by the sibling function :func:`nested_draw_forbidden_fields`
    below — kept separate rather than folded into a single recursive walk
    because the two call shapes differ (a container's own fields vs. each
    item of a list field), and unifying them into one generic recursive
    function would either need to guess how deep to descend or risk
    picking up marked fields on unrelated nested models reached through
    other paths (e.g. a future marked field on ``FacadeSegment``, itself
    already gated at the container level via ``facade_segments``).

    Deliberately does NOT also match ``CORRECTION_DRAW_DERIVED`` — the two
    markers' consumers have opposite post-construction semantics (see that
    marker's docstring), and this function's only caller
    (``_producer_preflight``'s top-level check, plus the b2 gate) needs the

    Companion to :func:`draw_forbidden_field_names`, one level down: where
    that function answers "which of THIS model's own fields are forbidden",
    this one answers "for each of this model's list-of-submodel fields,
    which of THAT submodel's fields are forbidden". Both read the SAME
    marker (``CORRECTION_DRAW_FORBIDDEN`` in ``json_schema_extra``), so a
    field marked once is picked up by whichever function matches its
    nesting depth — no second, hand-maintained name list at either level.

    This closes a drift that F-15's original fix (marker + top-level
    stripping/gate only) left open: ``WindowV3.facade_segment_id`` carries
    the marker (so the prompt-schema stripper already excludes it, since
    that stripper recurses through ``$defs`` and finds it regardless of
    nesting depth — see ``vocab.producer_facing_json_schema``), but the
    runtime draw-contract gates (``parse.py``'s b2 check,
    ``window_sources.py._producer_preflight``) each independently
    hardcoded the literal field name ``"facade_segment_id"`` instead of
    reading the marker — precisely the two-list drift pattern F-15 was
    meant to eliminate, just one level deeper than F-15 first looked.

    Only descends exactly one level (``list[BaseModel]`` fields whose item
    type itself declares at least one marked field); a submodel with no
    marked fields is simply absent from the returned mapping. Deliberately
    does not recurse further (e.g. into a list field's own nested list
    fields) — no current schema needs that depth, and guessing at it would
    risk snagging on unrelated future nesting.

    Intentionally excludes ``CORRECTION_DRAW_DERIVED``-marked fields (e.g.
    ``WindowV3.floor``) — see :func:`nested_draw_derived_fields` and that
    marker's docstring for why a post-construction "is it populated?" check
    (which is how ``_producer_preflight`` uses this function's result) would

    `deterministic.apply_deterministic_core` writes this UNCONDITIONALLY on
    every schema-v3 completion — regardless of whether any correction,
    envelope reconcile, or window-host resolution actually changed anything.
    This is deliberately a SEPARATE, always-present field, not a conditional
    `corrections[]` audit entry: `deterministic_core.envelope_atomic_transform`
    (envelope_transform.py) only appends a record when there is something to
    move (`if not intents: return ... # no record left at all`), so a legal
    v3 product whose drawing already agreed with the facade evidence (no
    intents) is byte-for-byte indistinguishable, in `corrections[]`, from one
    the core never touched. A missing conditional record can mean either "the
    core never ran" (untrustworthy) or "the core ran and had nothing to do"
    (fully trustworthy) — those two facts get compressed into the same
    blank. Only an unconditional field that is always written on completion,
    independent of what happened inside, can tell them apart.

    `version` is compared against `deterministic.DETERMINISTIC_CORE_STAMP_VERSION`
    by `judge.correction_score._is_trusted_output_convention` — the ONLY
    reader that treats it as a trust signal — with EXACT equality (same
    "declared identity, no fallback interpretation" discipline as
    `CORRECTION_OUTPUT_CONVENTION` in that module: an unrecognized version is
    untrusted, not coerced or guessed at). Deliberately a strict, separately
    named model (not a bare `dict`) even though the rest of this schema's
    audit trail uses flexible dicts (`corrections`/`conflicts`/`unsupported`):
    those lists hold heterogeneous rule-specific rows a stage need not
    over-specify; this field's whole job is a single, load-bearing identity
    check, so it gets the same strict-typing treatment as this module's other
    v3-only identity fields (`FacadeSegment`, `NorthAxisEvidence`).

    Marked `CORRECTION_DRAW_FORBIDDEN` — like `facade_segments`/`north_axis`,
    a correction draw that pre-fills this field is the model claiming a
    provenance fact only the deterministic core is allowed to assert, and is
    rejected at the raw-payload preflight (`parse.py`'s b2 gate,
    `window_sources.py`'s `_producer_preflight`) via the SAME
    `draw_forbidden_field_names` marker scan those already use — no separate
    edit needed there. Belt-and-suspenders only: `apply_deterministic_core`
    unconditionally OVERWRITES this field (plain assignment, never "if

# F-9 route② S0 (2026-08-11, design v2.1 §4.2/§10): raw, model-facing v3
# window-citation draw. `CorrectionDrawV3CitationV2` is an INDEPENDENT
# strict model, not a field-deleted view of `CorrectedGeometryV3` (v2.1
# §4.2: "它应是独立 strict Pydantic model，不是从 full model dump schema
# 后临时删字段"). It reuses `FloorV3`/`CellV3` unchanged — window/z/cell
# geometry are out of this batch's scope (v2.1 §0: "本批只改 Window.span
# 的 world-along authority") — but replaces `Window`/`WindowV3` with
# `WindowCitationV2`, which structurally CANNOT carry `span`, a derived
# `floor` echo, or `facade_segment_id`: the model has no field for them at
# all, so a payload that supplies one is a pydantic `extra="forbid"`
# violation (backstopped by the raw-key preflight in
# `parse.parse_raw_correction_draw`, which gives it the stable
# `producer_window_span_populated` code before pydantic's generic error —
# v2.1 §4.2).
#
# S0 ONLY defines these types and leaves them fully unwired: nothing in
# `pipeline.py`, `finalize.py`, `window_sources.py`, or any live production
# path constructs, accepts, or dispatches on `CorrectionDrawV3CitationV2`
# yet (v2.1 §10 S0: "均先不接 live production"). Wiring the live prompt/
# parser onto this type is S3/S4.
