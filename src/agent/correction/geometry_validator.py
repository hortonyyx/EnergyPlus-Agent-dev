"""A0 §7 deterministic geometry validation on CorrectedGeometry (M2a / S1).

These are the *data-level* geometry invariants 1_correction must satisfy before
the kernel runs — checked on the corrected primitives (cells/windows/z), not on
the built surface graph (that is kernel.py's job). They are deterministic facts;
the check adapter (validator/checks/correction.py) wraps them into a CheckReport.

Invariants (block — A0 §7):
  - **coverage**: per floor, cells tile the footprint with no holes and no
    overlaps (within tolerance). A hole is unmodelled floor area; an overlap is a
    correction defect (e.g. a corridor laid over the rooms it sits between).
  - **closure / non-degenerate**: every cell rectangle has positive extent on
    both axes; the footprint is non-degenerate.
  - **z-stack continuity**: adjacent floors stack with no gap/overlap beyond
    tolerance (a gap would model a mid-building interface as Roof + exposed Floor).

Cross-checks (flag):
  - **zone-count tripwire**: per-floor cell count vs testdata ``thermal_zones``
    (catches the 2f corridor-over-split class of coarse error).
  - **window-on-wall**: every window's along-facade span lies within its room's
    extent on that facade (catches axis-flip placement / floating windows).

Returns plain ``GeometryFinding`` lists; severity→layer mapping is the adapter's.

    ``floor_footprint`` is deliberately the only footprint entry point: legacy
    geometry gets its equivalent bbox ring and v3 gets its per-floor polygon.
    Shapely receives those rings directly, so non-rectangular orthogonal areas
    are measured as polygons rather than approximated by their bounding boxes.

    ``area_delta`` (below) is a recorded conservation *bookkeeping* figure, not
    an independent gate: since ``union_area = covered_in_footprint +
    outside_area`` and ``footprint_area = covered_in_footprint + hole_area``,
    ``area_delta = |union_area - footprint_area| = |outside_area - hole_area|
    <= max(outside_area, hole_area)``. So area_delta can never exceed ``tol``
    unless hole or outside already does — it is always accompanied by one of
    them in ``problems``, never the sole offender. (Overlap area nets out of
    ``union_area`` before this identity, which is why it needs its own guard.)
    The actual conservation enforcers are the three separate guards below:
    hole / outside / overlap.
