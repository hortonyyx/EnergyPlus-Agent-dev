"""B2: multi-floor assembly — derive per-storey z from the frozen floor-level
ladder (B3 evidence) and stack single-floor projections into one
``CorrectedGeometryV3`` with ``floors[]`` of length N.

⭐ The whole point of this module (dispatch 2026-09-03ai / rework 2026-09-04a /
rework-2 2026-09-04g): the storey elevations are DERIVED from frozen reading
bytes, ⛔ never hand-filled.

Rework-3 (2026-09-04w) — round 3 fell to a forged CARRIER, not a forged claim
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rounds 1-2 fixed the surface (z dropped from the entry signature, then the
claim paths gated), so the round-3 reviewer stopped forging claims and forged
the CARRIER instead: ``ValidatedFloorLadder((SimpleNamespace(z_floor_m=12.34,
...),))`` — a public dataclass constructor whose ``_levels`` element annotation
Python never enforces at runtime — after which ``assemble_multifloor_geometry``
read ``level.z_floor_m`` straight off whatever it found inside.  The docstring
said "The SEALED assembly carrier" while no seal existed ([[design-doc-
described-what-code-never-implemented]], [[gate-measures-right-but-carrier-
gets-swapped]]).  Two type-level facts are enforced now:

  * **The constructor is sealed** (dispatch §一(a)): ``__init__`` compares a
    token that exists ONLY inside the ``_seal_validated_ladder`` closure — not
    a module attribute, never returned, never stored on an instance.  Every
    construction attempt from outside (a direct call, ``dataclasses.replace``,
    a subclass constructor) is a named ``LADDER_MINT_SEAL_REQUIRED`` /
    ``LADDER_SEALED_NO_SUBCLASS`` red.  ⭐ Closure-held is strictly stronger
    than a module-global ``_SEAL``: an underscore global is still reachable as
    an attribute of the module, a closure cell of a factory that has returned
    is reachable only by introspection.

  * **The carrier stores NO z-bearing state** (dispatch §一(c) moved to the
    consumption boundary — the exit check, ⛔ not a narrower entrance): its only
    field is the sealed ``CorrectionEvidenceBundleArtifactV1``.  The per-storey
    levels are RE-DERIVED on every read — ``validate_evidence_bundle`` first,
    then ``_byte_z`` resolution — so there is no stored element to swap, and a
    shell forged with ``object.__new__`` (which no ``__init__`` can stop)
    still cannot move a z: whatever artifact it ends up carrying is GATED AT
    THE READ.  Assembly's z is therefore never a value read off instance
    state; it is always re-derived from frozen bytes that re-passed the gate
    in that very call.

Why "a hand-filled z assembles" is now un-CONSTRUCTIBLE, not merely refused:
the only z that reaches assembly is computed inside ``_levels_of`` from an
artifact that must re-pass ``validate_evidence_bundle`` at the moment of the
read.  Changing the assembled number requires supplying different frozen bytes
that still pass the gate — i.e. authoring a different frozen reading product,
which is the reading trust boundary the 2026-09-04p verdict adjudicated as out
of B2's scope.  (What no Python type layer can stop: runtime introspection that
reads this module's own closure cells or rebinds its globals — that is
equivalent to editing the code, and even then the z stays gated, because the
gate runs at consumption, ⛔ not at mint time only.)

Layering: this module depends only on the evidence contract, the correction
schema, and the geometry validator.  It never imports ``pipeline``.  The
model-driven orchestration that runs the evidence chain once per plan product
lives in ``pipeline.run_multifloor_correction`` (which imports THIS module, not
the other way round).

⛔ NOT this module's job (dispatch §四): opening synthesis (B4), touching the
projection bridge's geometry algorithm, relaxing the z-stack continuity check,
or reading gt.  It also does not specialise to sm25 — a specific storey count
or storey height is a reading, not a theorem: the storey count is COUNTED from
the data and each storey height is COMPUTED from it (⛔ no sm25 elevation
constant is written into this module — the acceptance greps for exactly that).

# ── W-1 T2-④ / BLK-1 (2026-09-07): the cross-floor footprint snap ──────────── #
#
# WHAT THIS IS: an explicit, tolerance-gated snap step between the per-floor
# chains and ``assemble_multifloor_geometry``.  Measured on sm25 (T1 probe,
# ``2026-09-07h_w1_t1_probe``): the two plan products are calibrated
# INDEPENDENTLY (each from its own dimension witnesses), so the same wall edge
# lands ~7-12 mm apart in the two floors' world coordinates, and assembly's
# zero-tolerance fingerprint comparison rejects it as a "setback".  That is a
# calibration residual, not a drawing error — per the user's 2026-09-07 domain
# ruling ("吸附/分辨率残差 = 机器直接修，真·画错才签字") it is machine-fix
# territory, ⛔ never a human-signing item.
#
# THE TOLERANCE IS FULLY DERIVED (verdict BLK-1, 2026-09-07i): ⛔ no invented
# constant, ⛔ no ``max(<derived>, <literal>)`` floor.  Both limbs of
#
#     tolerance = min(noise_bound, cap)
#
# are read from the plan products' OWN declarations:
#
#   noise_bound = hypot(bx_ref + bx_up, by_ref + by_up)
#       where b_axis = mm_per_px_axis × max|residual_px|_axis / 1000
#       — ``observations.calibration.{x,y}`` is the product's own per-axis
#       least-squares calibration; ``residual_px`` are the per-tick fit
#       residuals, and the max is RECOMPUTED from them (⛔ not read off the
#       self-reported ``max_abs_residual_px`` — a recompute, though the
#       declared summary is cross-checked and a drift is a named red).  Each
#       drawing independently calibrated ⇒ comparing a point across two
#       drawings compounds BOTH bounds per axis; the distance then combines
#       the two axes Euclideanly.
#
#   cap = min(thinnest declared wall of ref, of upper) / 2
#       from ``declarations.thickness_callouts_mm`` — the SAME semantics as
#       the same-day ladder CAP ruling (half the thinnest wall the source
#       itself declares; 2026-09-07 user ruling: ⛔ never a hard-coded
#       constant, the two cases both declare 0.06 m and baking that in would
#       freeze it).  Absorbing a displacement larger than half a wall stops
#       being "straighten the representation" and becomes "WHICH design is
#       this" — that is not this step's call, and it is exactly what trips
#       the existing loud ``PER_FLOOR_FOOTPRINT_MISMATCH`` instead.
#
# ⚠ The production as_drawn chain is floating-point metres, NOT quantised, so
# ``projection_bridge.resolution_from_units_per_metre``'s granularity (the
# fixture world's ``units_per_metre``) is 0.0 here and CANNOT be a tolerance
# source on this leg — its own docstring (N-3) requires the production caller
# to REDECLARE the granularity source, which is exactly what the calibration
# declarations above are.
#
# MATCHING SHAPE: the rings arrive here as CORNER-ONLY rings (the projection
# bridge's ``_corner_only_ring`` drops collinear subdivisions upstream, so
# both sm25 floors enter with 8 vertices each).  The snap is nonetheless
# gated on the SYMMETRIC Hausdorff distance between the two rings as point
# sets — Hausdorff is chosen precisely so this step does NOT depend on the
# two rings having equal vertex counts, a property the upstream producer is
# free to change (a future producer that keeps its collinear subdivisions,
# or whose wall-end jogs land at different along-edge positions per drawing,
# would make per-vertex correspondence structurally impossible again).
# Every vertex of either ring must lie within the tolerance of the OTHER
# ring's boundary polyline.  Within tolerance ⇒ the upper floor's ring
# is replaced VERBATIM by the reference ring (bitwise-identical ⇒ assembly's
# fingerprint comparison passes exactly, ⛔ not "approximately"); over
# tolerance ⇒ this step does NOTHING and ``assemble_multifloor_geometry``'s
# existing ``PER_FLOOR_FOOTPRINT_MISMATCH`` fires unchanged — a real setback
# is never swallowed.  ⚠ Replacing the ring does NOT touch the floor's cells:
# they keep their own drawing's coordinates (the schema enforces no
# cell-in-footprint containment), leaving them ~the same residual off the
# adopted ring, inside the same declared bound.

    """W#6: reconcile the upper floors onto the reference floor, ON THE CUT
    LINES, and RE-PARTITION every floor from its (possibly aligned) lines.

    WHY this replaced ``snap_footprints_to_reference`` in the wiring (the
    measured root cause of W#6): the verbatim ring swap replaced floor 2's
    footprint ring with floor 1's while LEAVING floor 2's cells from its own
    partition — coverage conservation broke by 0.3806 m² against a 0.05 gate.
    Aligning the cut lines instead and re-partitioning keeps ring and cells
    from the SAME arrangement, so conservation survives BY CONSTRUCTION
    (measured on sm25: both floors at 0.000000 while the rings become
    bit-identical — which is what assembly's zero-tolerance compare needs).

    The alignment absorbs exactly the same quantity the old snap did — the
    cross-floor calibration residual, gated by the SAME fully-derived
    tolerance (``footprint_snap_tolerance_m``: noise limb from both
    products' declared calibration residuals, cap limb half the thinnest
    declared wall) — but as WALL POSITIONS, not as a ring transplant:

      * a wall line moves only onto the reference floor's NEAREST same-axis
        wall position, only within the tolerance (openings follow their
        host, in band);
      * a wall with no counterpart within the tolerance keeps its own
        position — genuinely different layouts are never touched, and a
        still-mismatched footprint after re-partitioning is the existing
        loud ``PER_FLOOR_FOOTPRINT_MISMATCH`` in assembly, unchanged;
      * the reference floor itself is re-partitioned verbatim from its own
        filed lines (the deterministic re-run of the chain's own

    :func:`derive_floor_ladder` (which runs the frozen-byte gate first).  A bare
    ``Sequence[_DerivedFloorLevel]`` — or anything else — is type-refused as
    ``UNSEALED_FLOOR_LADDER``, so no low-level-helper combination re-acquires
    production assembly capability.  ⭐ And this boundary does not TRUST the
    carrier's history either: the levels it consumes are RE-DERIVED through the
    carrier's read path (``tuple(ladder)`` -> gate + ``_byte_z`` resolution),
    ⛔ never read off stored instance state — so even an ``object.__new__``
    shell or a post-hoc-swapped artifact assembles only bytes that re-pass the
    gate in THIS call.  Each output floor's ``z_floor`` / ``ceiling_height``
    are re-stamped from that derived rung's BYTE-RESOLVED z, ⛔ never from
    whatever the incoming single-floor geometry carried.
    ``single_floor_geometries`` supplies only the XY (id/name/footprint/cells),
    one per storey, ground-up (``ladder[i]`` pairs with
    ``single_floor_geometries[i]``).
    Explicit doors/passages are refused until assembly can preserve their
    positions while restamping storey elevations; they must not disappear.

    Loud, never silent (T4):
      * ``ladder`` is not a ``ValidatedFloorLadder`` -> ``UNSEALED_FLOOR_LADDER``;
      * the carrier carries no sealed artifact (an ``object.__new__`` shell or
        a stripped instance) -> ``LADDER_CARRIER_CORRUPT`` (from the read path);
      * the carrier's artifact fails the re-run gate (e.g. a drifted ``z_m``)

      * a derived level with ``ceiling_height_m <= 0`` ->
        ``NONPOSITIVE_CEILING_HEIGHT`` (defense-in-depth: unreachable through
        the sealed surface, because ``_mint_ladder`` refuses non-ascending
        rungs — kept for a future assembler that stamps z from elsewhere);
      * a single-floor geometry not carrying exactly one floor
        -> ``EXPECTED_SINGLE_FLOOR_GEOMETRY``;
      * two storeys sharing a floor id -> ``DUPLICATE_FLOOR_ID`` (downstream
        cell ids are ``{floor_id}-cNNN``; a duplicate would collide cells).

    ⭐ B-3 (dispatch §二 / §三 / verdict B-3): the common-footprint invariant is
    checked by an EXPLICIT pre-construction comparison of every floor's footprint
    fingerprint (:func:`_footprint_fingerprint`, the schema's own algorithm).  A
    mismatch is raised by name as ``PER_FLOOR_FOOTPRINT_MISMATCH`` HERE, before
    the schema construction runs.  ⛔ The construction's ``ValidationError`` is
    NO LONGER inspected by ``loc``/``type`` or by any substring of ``str(exc)``:
    ``PER_FLOOR_FOOTPRINT_MISMATCH`` comes ONLY from this pre-check, so ANY schema
    error at construction (empty floor id, a future windows/segments rule, …)
    propagates RAW and can never be mislabeled as a footprint mismatch
    (acceptance #4, as a RULE — ⛔ not a list of exceptions).

    Then the stacked floors MUST pass the existing z-stack continuity check
    (``geometry_validator.check_zstack``, the same rule as
    ``pipeline.correction_draw_issues`` at pipeline.py:661): a break is
    ``Z_STACK_DISCONTINUITY``.  ⛔ The check is neither bypassed nor relaxed
    (T3) — it is called, and its "not ok" is raised.  (⚠️ By construction the
    stacked ladder is continuous; this guard therefore has teeth only against a
    future assembler that stamps z from some other source.  Its passing is a
    guardrail, ⛔ not an acceptance signal — see dispatch §三①.)

    ⭐ Localised assumption (invariant #6): assembly is COMMON-FOOTPRINT only —
    the current "共底面盒子 / 每层满铺楼板" simplification.  Per-floor DIFFERENT
    footprints (setback / 退台) are explicitly NOT this module's job (dispatch
