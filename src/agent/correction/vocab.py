"""Mechanically-derived correction schema vocabulary — the SINGLE source both
the correction system prompt (F-4b) and the inner-retry corrective message
(F-4a) read from.

Why this module exists: the correction LLM draw is single-shot, and its only
feedback on a schema rejection used to be a *blind* re-issue of the same
prompt — ``_call_json_llm`` wrote the validation error to disk and retried
verbatim, so a systematic schema misunderstanding (e.g. an unknown
``north_axis`` key, or a non-vocabulary window ``provenance`` key) burned the
whole retry budget on the same mistake and then crashed the flow. The fix tells
the model *which field* broke and *what the legal tokens are* — but the legal
tokens MUST come from the schema itself (``WINDOW_CLAIMS`` /
``NorthAxisEvidence.model_fields``), never from a hand-copied second list. A
second list is a second ruler, and this project has been bitten by that before.

These helpers derive the vocabulary mechanically, so a schema change propagates
to both the prompt and the retry message with no manual sync step to forget.
They carry ONLY format / word-list information — never geometry, upstream
reading content, gt, or numeric values from a rejected draw.
