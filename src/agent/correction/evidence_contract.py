"""②-2 module 2: the correction-side evidence contract (2026-08-30).

TYPE LAYER ONLY.  This module defines the unified evidence bundle the
correction stage will consume -- source refs, the four positive wall-claim
kinds, the three face-line dispositions -- plus the validator for hard
invariants 1-8 of the approved design (§4.4).  It wires NOTHING: no adapter
lives here (module 3), no compiler (module 4), no pipeline change, and the
as-drawn disposition stays exactly where it was.

Authority: the approved ②-2 design (see the verdict document of 2026-08-30),
§3.2 / §3.3 / §4.1 / §4.2 / §4.3 / §4.4, with one deliberate override -- the
design's two-valued ``counterface_state`` was superseded by cross-review
finding N-1, so this module ships THREE values (``ink_present_unpromoted``
must carry a pixel-witness pointer).  ⛔ Deriving that third value from
today's prose products is module 3's job; a regex over free text is banned
everywhere (design §4.1).

Identity discipline (design §3.2)
---------------------------------
Every reference is ``ArtifactPointerV1`` / ``ObservationRefV1``: input_id +
contract + sha256 + json_pointer into FROZEN source bytes, never a copy of a
geometry value.  ``WallClaim`` models carry ⛔ no ``pos_m`` / ``edges_m`` /
``runs_m`` / ``spacing_m``-style value fields at all -- a test derives the
forbidden-name set mechanically from the producer's own types (module 1) and
walks every field of every claim kind.  ``spacing_m`` is not even carried as
a cached audit value: with no reader there is nothing to prove it unread.

The ``src:<sha256>`` locator vocabulary and its generation principle are
REUSED from ``correction.window_sources`` (one definition, not a second
provenance scheme).

Reference integrity (NF-4, folded into this dispatch as task 3)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The cross-family review of module 1 measured five "structurally legal but
semantically false" corruptions that ALL passed: a dangling ``pairs[].face_b``,
a dangling bucket key, two face lines sharing one id, an out-of-range
``opening_candidates[].gap_index``, and a dangling ``pair_candidates[].face_b``.
This module's validator must make the FIRST THREE loud, and does:

* dangling ``face_b`` -- the selected pair's hypothesis node no longer matches
  the claim's two refs (``PAIR_HYPOTHESIS_MISMATCH``), and a ref whose
  ``observation_id`` names a face that does not exist fails dereference
  (``OBSERVATION_ID_MISMATCH`` / ``UNKNOWN_INPUT_ID``);
* dangling bucket key -- a disposition outside the face-line domain of its
  source is ``DISPOSITION_REFERENCES_UNKNOWN_FACE``; a face with no
  disposition is ``FACE_WITHOUT_DISPOSITION`` (BOTH directions are checked --
  the legacy validator/checks union absorbed one direction silently);
* duplicate face ids -- building the per-source observation index raises
  ``DUPLICATE_OBSERVATION_ID``, which is what "resolves uniquely" (design
  §4.4 #1) means operationally.

The fourth (``gap_index`` out of range) is pure reference integrity -- an
index pointing past a face line's ``gaps`` list is a dangling reference, no
prose parsing involved -- so THIS module catches it too
(``OPENING_GAP_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE``).

The fifth (a dangling ``pair_candidates`` entry that no selected pair uses)
is ⛔ NOT caught here and is PINNED in the test file: the bundle references
only selected pairs (design §4.3 -- ``pair_candidates`` is the candidate
graph, not wall claims), so an unselected dangling candidate is invisible to
this layer.  It belongs to module 3 (the adapter walks candidates) and
module 4 (the compiler recomputes the candidate graph and must dereference
``face_b`` there).  ⛔ Do not leave this as a silent gap between documents.

Cross-review rework (2026-08-31): two structural invariants the first
review found missing, both intra-bundle (no adapter, no prose) --
---------------------------------------------------------------
F-1 payload closure: a ``present`` channel must actually carry payload
(``walls`` -> a wall claim or a disposition; ``plan_openings`` -> an
opening claim); zero payload is legal ONLY with an explicit
``zero_payload_channel`` debt -- an honest "wired, produced nothing this
run", ⛔ never a silent empty run.  The three channels with no payload
member on this bundle can never witness a present, so for them the debt is
the only legal companion to a ``present`` row.
F-2 single sourcing: identity IS ``input_id`` (design §3.2), so every ref
on ONE claim must point into the SAME frozen source.  A wall whose two
faces live in two different products is structurally legal (``F01``/
``F02``-style ids exist in every floor's product, so hypothesis and
candidate matches still succeed) but physically impossible.
