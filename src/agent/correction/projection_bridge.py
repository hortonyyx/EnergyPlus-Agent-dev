"""B1 projection bridge: wall IR → rooms (``CorrectedGeometryV3`` cells).

Design authority: the projection-bridge design doc v7 (see the proposals
folder — ⛔ no repo-rooted path here, F-152: a repo path inside a .py string
constant would fabricate a dependency edge) — §四 the four steps, §六之三
the zero-parameter extension rule, §9.1 the collinear-gap contract.  This
module is the geometric core only:

    ① cut lines  = every wall midline + every opening span (as a midline
                   continuation) + collinear gaps (contract §9.1 option ①)
    ② endpoint extension: extend an endpoint onto a perpendicular line's
                   midline when the extending wall's band intersects the
                   other line's solid rectangle (touching counts)
    ③ cells      = the arrangement's bounded faces (shapely polygonize)
    ④ footprint  = the union of all bounded faces

The judge-side "wall → cavity" derivation is deliberately NOT reused
(design §三 路 C): this bridge cuts on midlines, the judge cuts on faces,
so the judge keeps its discriminating power over this module's defects.

Orthogonality (design §9.2): this bridge handles orthogonal midlines only,
and that assumption is LOCAL — it lives in exactly two places, the
``CutLineV1.axis`` literal type and :data:`ORTHOGONAL_AXES`.  A non-x/y axis
is rejected loudly at :func:`_validated_axis` (upstream, the wall compiler
already raises on non-x/y axes, so one cannot reach here today).

⭐ Length/thickness constants are FORBIDDEN in this module (guide §十三 #1):
every size is read from the data being processed (the other wall's own
declared thickness, this wall's own half thickness, the input's own declared
coordinate resolution).  The single tolerance is the input's declared
coordinate resolution — see :func:`resolution_from_units_per_metre`.

    """W#6: replace each of the FOUR exterior edges' pos by its DECLARED axis.

    WHY (dispatch S-B, measured): each floor's pixel-side projection is
    perfectly self-consistent (ring == cells union, 0.0000 m²), but the
    same wall edge lands ~7-14 mm apart in the two floors' independently
    calibrated world coordinates, and the cross-floor snap that replaced
    floor 2's ring with floor 1's broke that floor's own conservation
    (0.3806 m² vs a 0.05 gate).  The correct axis positions are not
    anywhere in the ink — the drawing declares them: ``overall_mm`` and
    the exterior thickness callout give the axis frame
    ``[t/2, overall − t/2]``, IDENTICALLY for every floor whose declared
    chains agree.  Taking the four exterior edges from the declarations
    makes the two floors' rings EQUAL BY CONSTRUCTION (assembly's
    zero-tolerance compare passes with no snap) and keeps each floor's
    conservation (the cells are partitioned from the SAME snapped lines
    as the ring), so the cross-floor snap step has nothing left to do.

    Scope (measured on sm25, dispatch S-B stop-trigger 1): INTERIOR wall
    axes do NOT sit on the declared dimension ticks (nearest misses
    121.6-2358.7 mm against a ~8 mm noise bound) — snapping them to the
    nearest tick would DISPLACE geometry, not fix it.  Interior walls
    keep their pixel-side positions; only the four exterior edges move.

    All sizes are read from the data (guide §十三 #1): the frame comes
    from ``overall_*_m`` + the matched thickness callout; the matched
    callout is the one NEAREST the exterior wall's own resolved
    thickness; and BOTH gates (thickness-match and off-frame) use the
    same CAP limb the ladder/snap family already uses — half the
    thinnest declared wall, ``min(thickness_callouts_mm)/2``.  Beyond
    that cap this is not a representation fix ("which design is this")
    and the existing gates own the refusal:

      * ``EXTERIOR_WALLS_MISSING`` — a run axis with no wall line;
      * ``EXTERIOR_THICKNESS_UNDECLARED`` — the exterior wall's resolved
        thickness matches NO declared callout within the cap (the frame
        cannot be derived from this drawing's own declarations);
      * ``EXTERIOR_WALL_OFF_DECLARED_FRAME`` — the pixel-side exterior
        edge sits further than the cap from its declared axis position
        (a drawing error, ⛔ never silently absorbed here).

    Openings riding an exterior wall follow it: their cut lines borrow
    the host wall's pos verbatim (``cut_lines_from_wall_compilation``),
    so any line within the exterior wall's own half-thickness band of
    the old pos moves with it.  Interior walls are structurally outside
    that band (their axis sits at least their own half thickness plus
    the exterior wall's beyond the exterior axis), so they cannot be
    caught by it.

    This REPLACES the geometry-level "replace the upper ring verbatim" snap
    as the cross-floor reconciliation: the upper floor's cut lines are
    aligned (pos only — the along extents are untouched) and the floor is
    RE-PARTITIONED from the aligned lines, so its ring and its cells come
    from the SAME arrangement again and coverage conservation survives the
    alignment by construction (measured on sm25: verbatim-ring snapping
    broke floor 2's conservation by 0.3806 m²; aligned-lines re-partition
    keeps both floors at 0.000000 while making the rings bit-identical).

    The alignment is a RESIDUAL absorption, ⛔ never a re-shape: a wall
    moves only onto the reference floor's NEAREST same-axis wall position,
    and only within ``tolerance_m`` (the caller derives it from the two
    products' own calibration/thickness declarations — see
    :func:`multifloor.footprint_snap_tolerance_m`).  A wall with no
    reference counterpart within the tolerance keeps its own position —
    genuinely different layouts (an upper floor's own interior walls) are
    metres away from any reference wall and are never touched.

    an opening cut line borrows its host's pos verbatim upstream, so any

    openings — 76 fail structurally, in two classes: (a) the wall's own
    resolved coverage EXCLUDES the opening gap, so the span sits between
    two segments OF THE SAME wall and matches both; (b) the midline is a
    DERIVED ``(face_a + face_b) / 2`` float, so the touching boundary is
    off by up to ~1 ulp (measured ``+4.3e-16`` on L009) and exact
    comparison flips.  The reference graph resolves 23/23 faces to exactly
    one wall — zero tolerance, zero geometry, and no invented epsilon.

    edges, 94 vertices on sm25's ground-floor footprint where the building
    has 8 corners, and the same batch on the cells (S3b, ruling
    2026-09-07x §二: cell min edges 1.62/0.55 cm before reduction).  The

    unchanged to the last float bit).  A vertex that is NOT exactly
    collinear is a real corner of the arrangement and is kept even if the
    edge it creates is short — ⛔ this helper is not an edge-length filter.
    One pass is confluent: a corner whose neighbour was dropped cannot
