"""The as_drawn evidence-chain leg's writer-replay provenance carrier (W#3).

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (wallhunt 2026-09-08b, dispatch 2026-09-08c S-A):
``StageRunner.record``'s B5 anti-tamper lock replays the LEGACY deterministic
core (``extract_authoritative_envelope`` + ``apply_deterministic_core``) from
the marker's embedded bytes and rejects any candidate whose core-owned
projection drifts.  An as_drawn-chain candidate dies at that replay BY
CONSTRUCTION — its geometry came through the projection bridge, snap and
assembly, not the legacy envelope core — so the wall was
``writer_core_projection_drift`` on every genuine as_drawn write.

The fix is NOT to weaken the lock: it is a SECOND replay of equal strength,
one per leg, dispatched by an explicit marker this carrier provides.  Equal
strength means the same property F-22 BLOCKER-1 round 2 established for the
legacy leg — the accepted geometry must be reproducible, field for field,
from FROZEN UPSTREAM BYTES through the real production functions:

  elevation bytes  -> ``derive_floor_ladder``                (z rungs)
  plan bytes       -> ``adapt_as_drawn_plan``                (evidence)
  compilation bytes-> ``cut_lines_from_wall_compilation`` +
                      ``project_cut_lines``                  (per-floor geom)
  plan bytes       -> ``read_plan_calibration_declaration`` +
                      ``snap_footprints_to_reference``       (cross-floor snap)
  ladder + snapped -> ``assemble_multifloor_geometry``       (the producer)
  plan + producer  -> window population, then optional
                      ``populate_as_drawn_openings``          (explicit recipe)
  producer         -> ``build_verified_window_inputs_as_drawn`` +
                      ``finalize_as_drawn_chain_geometry``   (the final geom)

The one link the deterministic replay cannot re-derive is the decision loop's
model beat — exactly as the legacy replay cannot re-derive the model's draw.
Each leg therefore carries that model product as frozen embedded bytes: the
legacy leg inside ``VerifiedWindowResolverInputs.producer_draw_canonical_
bytes``; THIS leg inside ``AsDrawnFloorCompilationV1.compilation_bytes``, the
final ``WallCompilationV1`` the loop settled on (whose ``content_sha256`` the
loop's own outcome record and the projection envelope both already bind to).

Every OTHER byte the replay consumes comes from the marker's embedded
artifacts (view manifest + all reading products), cross-checked per floor by
``source_bytes_sha256`` — the same anchor ``chain_source_record.json`` files
on disk during the chain run.  ⛔ The writer never reads the run directory:
everything it replays from travels inside the candidate's own carrier, so the
lock stays a property of the attempt, not of files a caller could rewrite
afterwards.
