"""Self-verification for the **v2** three-layer as-drawn product — ⛔ needs no gt.

This is the v2 port of ``checks_as_drawn.py``.  The v1 file consumes the old
``wall_bands`` shape, so every reverse/forward-ledger number in the experiment
README was produced by the v1 product — exactly the mixed-evidence problem the
second cross-family review rejected the design draft for.  This file re-asks the
same three questions of the shape that actually exists now.

⛔ It still does NOT render the product to an image and compare images: a
renderer sharing the reader's wrong assumption would agree with it.  Every
element is turned into PIXEL INDICES and the ORIGINAL image is sampled there.

⭐ What changed with the three-layer shape:

* **The ink families are discovered, not written down here.**  Which discovered
  family is structure / furniture is read out of the product's own
  ``hypotheses.family_roles.assignment`` — a perception output.  Point it at the
  wrong family and these checks go red, which is the point: the naming has to be
  falsifiable, or the model could have said anything.
* **Pairing is a hypothesis now**, so it is reconciled rather than assumed: do
  the referenced face lines exist, is any face line claimed twice, are the two
  supports disjoint.  Spacing-vs-callout is a separate, declaration-level check
  because an unexplained spacing is a *finding about the drawing's callouts*
  (sm24's undeclared 120 mm walls), not proof the observation is wrong.

Known blind spots (must stay stated, or the check gets trusted for more):
  * it cannot judge SEMANTICS beyond the role assignment — a correctly placed
    but mistyped opening reads green;
  * it cannot judge "should this stroke have been split in two" — that is the
    reading grade's endpoint criterion.

    with support columns = the two real strokes, runs = their union, every metre
    recomputed by the producer's own affine, and every gap profile honestly
    re-measured over the widened strip.  ⛔ NOTHING in that product is fabricated,
    and it beat the honest product on two criteria (C2 98.7 > 98.6, C4 0.473 <
    0.722) with all eight gates green and the gt-side score unchanged.

    Why every other gate was blind: they all anchor on the aperture the PRODUCT
    chose.  ``edges_m`` is recomputed from the product's own support columns --
    declare a wider strip and the recomputation simply agrees.  The reverse
    ledger asks whether ANY column of the strip has ink.  Nothing asked the one
    question that separates a real filled band from two lines with white space
    between them: **is the strip one stroke?**

    ⛔ Threshold-free: it mirrors ``_ink_groups``'s OWN grouping rule (a column
    counts when it carries >= ``min_support`` rows of a run at least
    ``min_run_px`` long; groups split on a gap wider than 1 px).  Measured:
    honest sm25 1F all 49 face lines -> 1 group; honest sm24 all 98 -> 1 group
