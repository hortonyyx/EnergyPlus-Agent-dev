"""⭐ reading grade — 线段对线段, against the machine-defined denominator.

This is the D step: the reading judge the batch guide asked for.  It scores the
as-drawn product against ``denominator.py``'s targets, in BOTH directions, with
one criterion per failure mode the third cross-family review named:

  C1 POSITION   is the drawn face line where the answer's face line is?
                ⭐ and is it a DIFFERENT observation (or a different EDGE of one
                filled band) for each of a wall's two faces?  One thin stroke
                drawn down the middle of a 120 mm wall sits within tolerance of
                BOTH faces; without this rule a centreline reading -- the shape
                the batch guide forbids outright -- scored exactly like the
                honest product (fourth cross-family review, GLM).
  C2 COVERAGE   is the answer's run actually drawn over its whole length?
                (少画 — the failure a "does it look right" glance never sees)
  C3 SEGMENTATION  do the reading's run ENDS land on the answer's run ends?
                (错切 — one stroke drawn straight through a doorway is C1+C2
                 perfect and still wrong; the gt-free ledger says so itself:
                 "it cannot judge whether a stroke should have been split")
  C5 OPENING    is each opening the answer has both FOUND and NAMED right?
                (门窗身份 — ⭐ measured 2026-08-24: swapping every door and window
                 in the reading moved the gt-side reconstruction by 0.0 points,
                 because that check only ever asks "is this stretch an opening")
  C4 EXTRA      length the reading claims as wall that no target explains AND
                that the answer does not even ALLOW.  ⭐ The jamb caps D2 keeps
                out of the targets are real strokes on the drawing: not scored
                for, and (since the fourth review) not scored against either.
                (多画 — ⭐ the direction a gt-only ruler REWARDS: claiming a
                 line runs edge-to-edge raised the old reconstruct score above
                 the honest product's)

⭐ Only face lines PERCEPTION positively called walls are graded.  A face line it
declared ``non_wall`` / ``ambiguous`` is not silently forgiven either: it is
counted in the abstention ledger, and any TARGET left uncovered because of it
still scores as missing.  So abstaining cannot buy points -- it only moves the
loss from C4 to C2.

⛔ Tolerances are declared, reported and swept; ⛔ none of them is invented to
make a number look good.
