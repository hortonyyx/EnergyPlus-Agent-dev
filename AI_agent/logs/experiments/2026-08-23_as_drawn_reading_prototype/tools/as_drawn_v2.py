"""As-drawn plan transcription, **v2 schema** — three layers, no domain classification.

⭐ Why this file exists (2026-08-23): two cross-family reviews rejected the v1
prototype, and the second one's headline was that the DESIGN DOCUMENT described
a shape the CODE did not implement -- so every number quoted in support of it
had actually been produced by the v1 shape.  This module is that shape, for
real, so the numbers can be re-measured on the thing being proposed.

The product is split into three layers, and the split is the whole point:

  ``observations``   what a ruler measured on pixels.  ⭐ The only scorable
                     layer, and the only one a downstream consumer may treat
                     as fact.
  ``declarations``   what the drawing or its config ASSERTS, transcribed
                     verbatim.  Compared by text, never by meaning.
  ``hypotheses``     everything derived from the first two.  ⛔ Not scored and
                     droppable in one piece.

The property that makes the split worth having: **``observations`` +
``declarations`` must be enough to re-derive every hypothesis.**  A field that
fails that test is smuggling a judgement.

What changed from v1, and why each one was forced:

  * **No bridging.**  v1 merged blank stretches shorter than 0.60 m into the
    run and labelled the rest ``break``.  The first review showed the same
    0.60 m does opposite work on the two ink layers (closing dropouts in wall
    lines, swallowing piers between windows).  Runs here are RAW maximal
    continuous stretches and every blank is reported.
  * **No ``class`` on a gap.**  A gap carries measurements; naming it is
    1_correction's job.
  * **Re-computable opening evidence.**  v1 emitted two aggregate cyan-pixel
    counts at one fixed window, and a consumer who disliked the window could
    not recompute.  Worse, the check built on it could be satisfied by ONE
    pixel.  Each gap now carries a distance PROFILE plus the along-gap span
    that actually has opening ink, and the components themselves are emitted.
  * ⭐ **No colour is called a wall.**  ``plan_ink.ink_families`` hard-codes
    ``neutral -> structure`` / ``cyan -> fenestration`` / ``magenta ->
    furniture``.  That is a drawing convention, and inventing it in code makes
    every unfamiliar drawing style a silent failure -- which is exactly how
    F-69 happened (windows lived on a colour layer the one mask could not see,
    and it returned a confident zero).  Ink families are now DISCOVERED by
    measurement (``ink_palette``) and left unnamed; which family carries walls
    and which carries openings is **perception, so it comes in from outside**
    (the model; here, the config stands in for it) and is recorded as a
    hypothesis with the measured evidence beside it.  ⛔ An assignment naming a
    family the drawing does not have is a LOUD failure, never a quiet zero.
  * **Pairing is a hypothesis with every admissible partner listed.**  v1 took
    the first admissible partner and broke.  (Measured: that greedy order was
    not what mis-paired sm24 -- 0 of its 98 lines had more than one admissible
    partner -- but enumerating costs nothing and removes the question.)
